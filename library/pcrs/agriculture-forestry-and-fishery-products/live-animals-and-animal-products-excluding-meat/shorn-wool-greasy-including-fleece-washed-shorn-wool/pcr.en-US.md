# Shorn greasy sheep wool at the producing farm gate

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This rule covers sheep/lamb fleece cut from live animals and transferred as greasy, unscoured wool at the producing farm gate. Optional fleece washing occurs **on the animal before shearing**. Post-shear scouring, degreasing, topmaking, pulled pelt wool, and goat or camelid hair are excluded. The CPC 02941 label is interpreted with the WCO Chapter 51 sheep/lamb definition of wool (`un-cpc-2025`; `wco-hs-2017`).

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `net_greasy_mass` | wool outputs | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh net as-received greasy wool after bale tare, not clean-wool yield (`iwto-wool-lca-2016`). |
| `moisture_state` | fleece | Mass fraction | % | Record moisture method, date and wet/dry basis; fleece-washed is not scoured. |
| `flock_period` | flock activity | Original activity property | original unit | Assign events to flock/cohort and year before per-kg normalization. |
| `inventory_reference_normalization` | all inventory rows | Actual flow property | exchange unit per reference flow | The inventory and collection aggregation fields below express final amounts per declared reference flow. Keep all raw collection records, original denominator qualifiers, route/period strata, unit conversions and allocation requirements. For each flow, first obtain its attributable amount in its own numerator unit using the existing rules; then divide by the measured accepted reference-output quantity of the same scope and multiply by the declared reference quantity. Do not mix species, states, gates or incompatible routes; count transfers and shared burdens once. A missing, zero or untraceable accepted-output denominator is a blocking data-quality issue. Keep provisional QA ranges on their explicitly stated bases; they are not conversion factors or production defaults. These are final foreground-package contributions, not replacements for stage quantitative references or stage-native unit-process datasets. Retain stage records separately. Compute normalized amount = attributable raw amount * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final reference-output quantity. Apply normalization exactly once. |
| `stage_throughput_linkage` | stage records and final package contributions | Actual flow property and its stated raw basis | retain native numerator and stage denominator units | Keep the original lot, event, cohort, period and stage denominators with their units. Reconstruct the attributable numerator A with measured stage quantity Q_stage and documented attribution before final normalization. If a quoted amount a_B corresponds to an explicit stage basis B_stage (for example, 1000 kg), use A = a_B * Q_stage / B_stage. If r_stage is already an intensity in exchange-unit per stage-unit, instead use A = r_stage * Q_stage, with no second division by B_stage. A raw attributable total is used directly. Final contribution = A * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final output. Convert compatible units explicitly and apply each attribution/allocation share exactly once; never treat a quoted amount or intensity as a raw total. Link stage transfers, losses, rejects, stocks, shared services and allocation to the same actual route, period and final-output stratum. For a 1000 kg basis retain 1000 kg explicitly. Do not assume unit yield, equal fresh/dried mass, equal head mass, equal dose quality or interchangeable gates. Missing links, unsupported unit conversion, zero denominators and untraceable allocation block dataset production. Stage-native datasets retain their own stage reference; package contributions are a separate projection. |

## 5. System Boundary

Include managed sheep production, feed and pasture, manure, conditional pre-shear on-animal washing, shearing, farm airing/skirting, grade sorting, baling and producing-farm handover. Account for upstream purchased animal, feed, energy, water, fertilizer and packaging datasets once. Record rearing, replacements, culls and shared facilities across years. Stop before auction, post-farm freight, scouring, grease extraction and textile manufacture (`iwto-wool-lca-2016`).

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |

| starting_condition_role | flock starting inventory, not zero-burden animals |
| product_classification_scope | greasy shorn sheep wool only |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased greasy wool entering baling is a separately linked same-category input, never newly grown fleece |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Purchased animals, feed, nutrient, energy, water and packaging datasets where crossing boundary |
| disclosure | breed, farm, flock-year, wash route, shear and grade balances, animal/manure co-products, attribution method |

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `farm_gate_limit` | all nodes | Stop at accepted greasy-wool bale handover; exclude post-shear scouring and later logistics. | `un-cpc-2025`; `iwto-wool-lca-2016` |
| `wash_gate` | optional wash | Wash fleece while still on live sheep before shearing; document water, effluent and dry-off, retaining greasy output. | `wco-hs-2017` |
| `route_delta` | wash/no-wash | Both inherit flock husbandry; one fleece uses one route. Wash adds a separate node and inventory; no double route attribution. | `iwto-wool-lca-2016` |

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `flock_outputs` | fleece, live sheep/lambs, exported manure and other independent products | Prefer physical subdivision where separable; for shared flock burdens disclose and consistently apply a justified allocation such as period-specific economic value, with price and sensitivity. No zero-burden cull sheep or dual product/waste manure. | `iwto-wool-lca-2016` |
| `period_link` | breeding, replacement, growth, shearing and culling years | Link inputs, animal stocks, events and outputs across relevant years; amortize only with observed service/lifetime evidence. Assign animal-year burden once. | `iwto-wool-lca-2016` |
| `shared_assets` | pasture, housing, water system, shearing shed and equipment | Identify flock/shearing/baling consumers and service years; allocate shared use by documented hours, area or animal-time before product allocation; avoid node duplication. | `iwto-wool-lca-2016` |
| `grade_accounting` | accepted, downgraded and rejected fleece | Keep grade outputs and destinations separate; marketable downgrade is product, unsaleable skirtings waste, and fibre cannot be both. | `iwto-wool-lca-2016` |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `wool_balance` | shear to gate | captured = accepted grades + downgraded grades + skirtings + measured moisture/other loss; disclose residual | event and bale records | net reference mass and balance | `iwto-wool-lca-2016` |
| `enteric_method` | enteric CH4 | declared IPCC tier on age/diet/productivity-specific activity, with factor and unit conversion | cohort, diet, duration | kg CH4 distinct from manure | `ipcc-livestock-2019` |
| `manure_n_method` | manure N2O/NH3 | excreted N × management shares × distinct factors and conversions; reconcile N | excretion, management, factors | kg N2O and NH3 | `ipcc-livestock-2019` |
| `allocated_reference` | shared activities | activity × documented service-period and co-product shares ÷ net greasy wool | use logs, years, outputs and values | activity per kg reference | `iwto-wool-lca-2016` |
| `calc_pathway_emissions` | `flock` | Use species- and management-compatible methods and retain disaggregated pathway totals. Convert N2O-N to N2O by 44/28 and NH3-N to NH3 by 17/14 exactly once; already molecular masses are not reconverted. Check methane against the documented available-carbon/methane-potential balance and nitrogen losses against each stage's available N. Indirect formation from previously volatilised N is a downstream transformation, not a second source-stage N loss. Attribute and normalize once; do not duplicate linked treatment or fate-model emissions.  Use matched raw-period quantities before allocation for physical screens: CH4 mass × 12/16 must not exceed the carbon available to the represented pathway; source-stage NH3 mass × 14/17 plus direct N2O mass × 28/44 and other source N losses must not exceed that stage's available N, after accounting for stocks and transfers. Bound each indirect N2O-N calculation by its documented volatilised or leached N precursor, not by subtracting that downstream transformation again from the source ledger. These are conservation checks, not emission factors or an empirical per-product range.| `cp_pathway_emissions` | kg named compound per final reference flow | `ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |
| `calc_feed_supply_and_intake` | `feed` | Feed supply used by the represented operation = opening feed stock + receipts + on-site feed entering the operation - closing feed stock - documented unused returns or transfers out. Retain in-boundary spoilage, refusals and discarded leftovers in that supply. Actual intake = that supply - measured uneaten/discarded losses, after matching moisture/DM and period; use intake only for nutrition/metabolism. Opening stock retains its prior burden and is not another purchase. Trace any unused return or transfer and its burden destination; no automatic substitution credit. Attribute production once, through either the purchased-feed dataset or the represented on-site crop/collection node, never both for the same feed. Include actual waste treatment and manure contributions once, not as a second feed-production burden. | `cp_feed_supply_and_intake` | separate feed supply, intake and loss quantities, in matched as-fed/DM units | `fao-feed-loss-accounting-2018` |
| `calc_manure_n2o_coverage` | `manure_n2o`; `review_flock_indirect_n2o`; `review_flock_soil_direct_n2o`; `review_flock_soil_indirect_n2o` | For each actual manure stage, calculate direct N2O, volatilisation/deposition-derived indirect N2O, and applicable leaching/runoff-derived indirect N2O separately with documented species/system activity and factor basis. Convert N2O-N to molecular N2O by 44/28 once; do not reconvert molecular masses. Retain component worksheets. Where an existing N2O card covers both direct and indirect emissions, report their non-overlapping sum; where separate direct/indirect cards exist, assign each component once to its matching card and never also report the sum. Pasture deposition and land application use the managed-soil method, not a manure-storage factor. Assign foreground versus linked treatment/pasture coverage explicitly; a manure export does not erase earlier emissions, and already covered downstream emissions are not repeated. Account for stock, transfers and previous N losses in the nitrogen cascade; indirect N2O is a downstream transformation of its precursor, not a second source-stage N loss. Normalize attributed molecular masses once to the accepted reference output. Document inapplicability; absent pathway data are not zero. | `cp_manure_n2o_coverage` | kg molecular N2O by pathway and assigned existing card | `ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `identity` | wool | Document sheep/lamb origin, greasy state, on-animal wash, grade and farm gate; reject unknown post-shear wash. | shear and sale records |
| `completeness` | flock/fleece | Reconcile animals, feed, manure, capture, grades, co-products and rejects. | mass and stock balances |
| `temporal` | multi-year flock | Link animal age, events and shared assets to service years; disclose gaps. | cohort and asset registers |
| `measurement` | masses/moisture/energy | Retain calibration and original units; disclose estimates. | scale/meter records |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_identity` | reference/grades | Reject goat/camelid/pulled wool, post-shear scoured fibre, non-farm gate or unknown species; check greasy net kg. | `un-cpc-2025`; `wco-hs-2017` |
| `validate_route` | wash/no-wash | Confirm wash on living sheep before shear with water/effluent/dry-off evidence; one fleece uses one route. | `wco-hs-2017`; `iwto-wool-lca-2016` |
| `validate_balance` | fleece/co-products | Reconcile capture, grades, rejects, bale tare, live animals and manure; no product/waste dual classification. | `iwto-wool-lca-2016` |
| `validate_period` | flock/shared assets | Verify period, replacement, service and co-product shares sum once; no inherited-burden omission. | `iwto-wool-lca-2016` |
| `validate_binding` | concrete exchanges | Resolve unresolved inputs from actual records and exact UUIDs for concrete outputs before dataset publication. | |
| `v_pathway_emission_coverage` | `flock` | Require a pathway coverage ledger for enteric CH4 where biologically applicable, manure CH4, direct/indirect N2O, NH3 and relevant field emissions. Every pathway needs a measured/calculated value, a named linked process with matching coverage, or supported inapplicability; absent data cannot become zero. Keep wild life before capture outside managed husbandry, assess actual managed holding separately, and retain species-specific evidence. | `ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023` |
| `v_foreground_emission_responsibility` | Actual operated nodes and linked services | Record responsibility for on-site fuel combustion and refrigerant leakage when applicable: either quantified foreground emissions or a named linked process explicitly covering them, never merely a fuel-supply or electricity-production input. Assess special-taxon biological and residue emissions using species/route evidence, without a generic livestock factor. Identify any unresolved pathway and withhold a completeness claim; document supported absence and prevent duplicate upstream/downstream accounting. | |
| `v_feed_supply_intake_separation` | All feed inputs | Reject an upstream feed inventory reduced by in-boundary refusal, spoilage or discarded leftovers without retaining their production burden. Reconcile supply, intake, stock, transfers and loss destinations under calc_feed_supply_and_intake. Do not reuse intake as supplied feed, assume zero-burden on-site feed or grant automatic avoided-product credits. | `fao-feed-loss-accounting-2018` |
| `v_manure_n2o_coverage` | Applicable manure and managed-soil N pathways | Require explicit direct and indirect pathway coverage, stage N balances and molecular-mass conversion. Map each component to an existing N2O card or an explicitly covering linked process once under calc_manure_n2o_coverage. Missing indirect-pathway evidence prevents a completeness claim; no default zero or duplicate aggregate-plus-components. | `ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |

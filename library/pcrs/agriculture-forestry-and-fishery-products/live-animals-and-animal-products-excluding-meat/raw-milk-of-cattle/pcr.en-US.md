# Raw Milk of Cattle

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR applies to raw milk produced by domesticated cattle and delivered from the dairy farm as chilled,
unprocessed milk. It supports foreground data packages representing a full, representative dairy-farm operating
period up to the farm gate. The model covers the whole reporting herd, feed and bedding supply, directly managed
feed production when applicable, enteric fermentation, manure management, milking, cooling, and on-farm storage.

The PCR excludes raw milk of buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, and other animals; pasteurized, sterilized,
homogenized, separated, standardized, concentrated, dried, fermented, flavoured, or otherwise processed milk;
transport after the farm gate; dairy manufacturing; packaging; distribution; retail; use; and end of life.
A concrete data package shall state the cattle production system, geography, reporting period, herd structure,
milk composition, farm-gate condition, and whether feed production and input transport are foreground or linked
upstream.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_farm_gate` | Product system to farm gate | Include dairy herd maintenance and replacements, feed and bedding supply, enteric fermentation, manure collection/storage/treatment, directly managed feed production, input energy and water, milking, cleaning, cooling, refrigerant losses, and on-farm raw-milk storage up to milk ready to leave the farm. | `idf-dairy-carbon-footprint-2022`; `fao-leap-large-ruminants-2016` |
| `boundary_whole_herd` | Reporting herd | Represent lactating and dry cows, replacement animals, calves, culls, mortality, herd inventory change, and animal movements supporting reported milk output; do not model only lactating cows when other herd classes share burdens. | `idf-dairy-carbon-footprint-2022`; `fao-leap-large-ruminants-2016` |

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | A dairy production system with the reporting herd, managed land, and production assets in service at the opening of the reporting period; herd replacement burdens and inventory changes are represented through period records and annualized calculations. |
| starting_condition_role | Establishes a reproducible farm-accounting condition for a biologically continuous dairy system without treating the opening herd as burden-free. |
| product_classification_scope | Raw cattle milk covered by CPC 3.0 code 02211; other animal milk and processed dairy products are outside the category. |
| recursive_input_rule | Raw cattle milk produced and used internally, including milk fed to calves, is recorded as internal use and deducted from saleable farm-gate output rather than linked as an upstream raw-milk dataset. Externally purchased raw cattle milk is a separate product input with an upstream dataset and cannot be netted against output. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Every purchased feed, animal, energy carrier, material, and externally provided service crossing the boundary requires a representative upstream dataset or an explicit documented data gap; supplier-specific data are preferred when material. |
| disclosure | Declare farm geography, production system, reporting period, herd classes and inventory change, milk sold and internal use, milk composition, feed origins, manure systems, land management, allocation factors, excluded processes, data gaps, and any non-steady operational change. |

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_subdivision_first` | Separable farm activities and outputs | Subdivide directly attributable activities before allocation. Assign milking, milk cooling, and milk-storage burdens entirely to milk; separately accounted animal-rearing or exported crop/energy activities do not enter the shared dairy allocation pool. | `idf-dairy-carbon-footprint-2022` |
| `allocation_milk_live_animals` | Shared dairy-herd burdens between milk and live cattle | Apply the IDF 2022 biophysical net-energy method: `AF_milk = (NE_L × M_FPCM) / ((NE_L × M_FPCM) + Σ(NE_G,i × M_liveweight,i))`; use consistent period FPCM and live-weight sales, class-specific net energy for growth when available, and disclose every factor. The remaining fraction is assigned to live animals. | `idf-dairy-carbon-footprint-2022` |
| `allocation_manure` | Manure leaving the farm | Classify manure explicitly. Treat manure with essentially no value at the boundary as a residue using cut-off; if it is a co-product, use disclosed economic allocation; if it is waste, assign its treatment burdens to the dairy system without an avoided-product credit. | `idf-dairy-carbon-footprint-2022`; `fao-leap-large-ruminants-2016` |
| `allocation_internal_flows` | Internal milk, feed, and manure transfers | Cancel internal product transfers only after preserving their quantities and characteristics. Internal raw milk fed to calves reduces saleable output; internally produced feed and manure shall not receive duplicated upstream burdens. | `idf-dairy-carbon-footprint-2022`; `fao-leap-large-ruminants-2016` |

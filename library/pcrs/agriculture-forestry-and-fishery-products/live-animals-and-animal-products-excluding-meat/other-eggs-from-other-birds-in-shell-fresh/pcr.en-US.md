# Fresh non-hatching shell eggs of birds other than hens

## 1. Scope and Applicability

Covers fresh shell-on eggs of birds other than hens handed over for actual non-hatching use at the producer farm gate, including food and documented other unincubated uses; not human table eggs alone. Excludes hen and hatching eggs, broken/liquid/preserved/processed eggs and hatched birds. Managed laying, independent collection and farm-gate transfer are required; on-farm sorting and protective packing apply only when performed. Preserve species and lot-specific mass, count, grade, use, safety, storage time/conditions and actual gate. One kilogram does not imply cross-species nutritional or functional equivalence.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | pcr.agriculture-forestry-and-fishery-products.live-animals-and-animal-products-excluding-meat.other-eggs-from-other-birds-in-shell-fresh |
| classification_refs | CPC 3.0: 02322 Other eggs from other birds in shell, fresh |
| covered_products | Fresh other-bird shell eggs with actual non-hatching handover, including food and documented other uses. |
| excluded_products | Hen eggs, hatching eggs, broken/liquid/processed eggs, hatched birds and post-gate processing. |
| representative_product | One measured kilogram of intact fresh other-bird shell eggs at farm gate. |
| production_route | Managed flock laying is the parent; evidenced species and cage/barn/outdoor routes change feed, water, manure, cleaning, breakage and storage inventory and QA. Mutually exclusive flock routes are normalized separately; independent collection and conditional sorting/packing follow. |
| market_state | Fresh, shell-on, non-hatching handover with species, count, mass, grade, safety, packing and gate. |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Fresh non-hatching other-bird eggs in shell at actual producer farm gate. |
| How much | 1 kg measured transferable shell-on mass; retain count and lot-specific mean. |
| How well | Intact, safe and fresh, with species, grade, use and storage condition disclosed. |
| How long or cycle | Declared flock laying and reporting period linked to rearing and exit. |
| reference_flow_link | `reference_eggs` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Fresh non-hatching other-bird shell eggs at farm gate `c533a91e-a111-484e-a6a5-8fb8d3c41363` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Mass unit group `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |

The verified CPC 02322 Product/Mass UUID matches this explicitly farm-gate, shell-on reference and the terminal output. It does not authorize a hen, hatching, processing, count-only, or different-gate exchange.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mass` | reference eggs | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh shell-on mass excluding package and reconcile nodes and stocks by species/lot. |
| `count` | conversion of recorded egg counts to measured lot mass | Count plus measured Mass | eggs; kg | Retain count as a separate observed quantity. Use lot measurement or representative sample mean only to derive this lot's mass; no cross-species mean or claim that count itself has Mass property. |
| `feed` | feed | Mass | kg as-fed; kg dry matter | Retain measured conversion and source before combining as-fed/dry-matter feed. |
| `inventory_reference_normalization` | all inventory rows | Actual flow property | exchange unit per reference flow | The inventory and collection aggregation fields below express final amounts per declared reference flow. Keep all raw collection records, original denominator qualifiers, route/period strata, unit conversions and allocation requirements. For each flow, first obtain its attributable amount in its own numerator unit using the existing rules; then divide by the measured accepted reference-output quantity of the same scope and multiply by the declared reference quantity. Do not mix species, states, gates or incompatible routes; count transfers and shared burdens once. A missing, zero or untraceable accepted-output denominator is a blocking data-quality issue. Keep provisional QA ranges on their explicitly stated bases; they are not conversion factors or production defaults. Compute normalized amount = attributable amount * declared reference quantity / measured accepted reference-output quantity. Apply normalization once only; never divide an already normalized value again. |
| `stage_throughput_linkage` | stage records and final package contributions | Actual flow property and its stated raw basis | retain native numerator and stage denominator units | Keep the original lot, event, cohort, period and stage denominators with their units. Reconstruct the attributable numerator A with measured stage quantity Q_stage and documented attribution before final normalization. If a quoted amount a_B corresponds to an explicit stage basis B_stage (for example, 1000 kg), use A = a_B * Q_stage / B_stage. If r_stage is already an intensity in exchange-unit per stage-unit, instead use A = r_stage * Q_stage, with no second division by B_stage. A raw attributable total is used directly. Final contribution = A * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final output. Convert compatible units explicitly and apply each attribution/allocation share exactly once; never treat a quoted amount or intensity as a raw total. Link stage transfers, losses, rejects, stocks, shared services and allocation to the same actual route, period and final-output stratum. For a 1000 kg basis retain 1000 kg explicitly. Do not assume unit yield, equal fresh/dried mass, equal head mass, equal dose quality or interchangeable gates. Missing links, unsupported unit conversion, zero denominators and untraceable allocation block dataset production. Stage-native datasets retain their own stage reference; package contributions are a separate projection. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Admitted birds or on-site rearing history, purchased feed, supplied water, energy, health supplies and conditional packaging. |
| starting_condition_role | Managed laying passes through independent collection, conditional sorting/packing and farm-gate transfer. |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0 02322; hen, hatching and processing eggs, spent birds and manure have separate identities. |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased same-category eggs retain supplier dataset and distinct transfer; do not recreate laying or count as this farm's output. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Match birds, feed, water, energy, supplies and packaging upstream datasets by species, state, provider, geography and technology. |
| disclosure | Species, route, flock/phases, node gates, breakage/diversion/waste, storage conditions, co-outputs, shared assets and attribution. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `farm_gate` | all routes | Include laying, independent collection and actual on-farm sorting/packing to producer farm gate; exclude downstream incubation, processing and distribution. | `fao-codex-eggs`; `fao-leap-poultry` |
| `route_delta` | species/housing route | Relative to managed laying parent, evidence flock-specific feed, water, bedding/manure, cleaning, energy and storage inventory and QA deltas. | `fao-codex-eggs`; `fao-leap-poultry` |
| `collection` | newly laid eggs | Count, weigh and record breakage across independent collection; internal transfer is not final sale. | `fao-codex-eggs`; `fao-leap-poultry` |
| `conditional` | sorting/packing | Sorting needs at least two real destinations and handovers; packing needs material, reuse and pre/post protected state. | `fao-codex-eggs`; `fao-leap-poultry` |
| `period_assets` | flocks/shared assets | Attribute rearing, laying, exit and shared housing/collection/sorting assets by node/period; count source burdens once. | `fao-codex-eggs`; `fao-leap-poultry` |

###### Manure biogenic methane to air (`review_laying_manure_ch4`)

Calculate actual atmospheric release by manure system, climate, residence time and volatile-solids activity. Reconcile captured, destroyed or oxidised methane; produced methane is not automatically emitted methane. Applies only to the operated `laying` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

- Selected flow: Methane, biogenic, to air (UUID unresolved)
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg CH4
- Amount rule: Calculate the pathway total for this node and period, apply the existing allocation and stage_throughput_linkage, then inventory_reference_normalization exactly once to the measured final accepted reference output.
- Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`)
- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`)
- Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`)
- Collection protocol: `cp_pathway_emissions`
- Sources: `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`

###### Direct manure nitrous oxide to air (`review_laying_direct_n2o`)

Use the actual manure-management nitrogen pathway. Keep storage/treatment distinct from field application and grazing deposition, which require a managed-soil method and an explicitly assigned inventory responsibility. Applies only to the operated `laying` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

- Selected flow: Nitrous oxide to air (UUID unresolved)
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg N2O
- Amount rule: Calculate the pathway total for this node and period, apply the existing allocation and stage_throughput_linkage, then inventory_reference_normalization exactly once to the measured final accepted reference output.
- Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`)
- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)

###### Indirect manure nitrogen-derived nitrous oxide to air (`review_laying_indirect_n2o`)

Calculate attributable indirect N2O from documented manure N volatilisation/deposition and leaching/runoff pathways where applicable. Keep separate from direct N2O and reconcile any nitrogen-fate calculation already included downstream or in the chosen background/impact model. Applies only to the operated `laying` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

- Selected flow: Nitrous oxide to air (UUID unresolved)

###### Manure ammonia to air (`review_laying_nh3`)

Use actual species, housing/storage conditions and a justified nitrogen-flow method. Track total N and ammoniacal N by stage; a generic volatilised-N estimate is not automatically NH3 because it may include other nitrogen species. Applies only to the operated `laying` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

- Selected flow: Ammonia to air (UUID unresolved)
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg NH3
- Amount rule: Calculate the pathway total for this node and period, apply the existing allocation and stage_throughput_linkage, then inventory_reference_normalization exactly once to the measured final accepted reference output.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `balance` | egg nodes | Input = accepted + diverted + rejected + stock change within measurement uncertainty. | lot mass and stock | reconciled kg | `fao-codex-eggs` |
| `normalization` | inventory | Divide actual flock/period totals by measured transferred fresh shell-egg kg in same scope. | period totals and transfer mass | per-kg inventory | `fao-leap-poultry` |
| `asset` | shared assets | Allocated totals from measured service drivers must equal original burden. | asset total and node use | once-attributed burden | `fao-leap-poultry` |
| `calc_pathway_emissions` | `laying` | Use species- and management-compatible methods and retain disaggregated pathway totals. Convert N2O-N to N2O by 44/28 and NH3-N to NH3 by 17/14 exactly once; already molecular masses are not reconverted. Check methane against the documented available-carbon/methane-potential balance and nitrogen losses against each stage's available N. Indirect formation from previously volatilised N is a downstream transformation, not a second source-stage N loss. Attribute and normalize once; do not duplicate linked treatment or fate-model emissions.  Use matched raw-period quantities before allocation for physical screens: CH4 mass × 12/16 must not exceed the carbon available to the represented pathway; source-stage NH3 mass × 14/17 plus direct N2O mass × 28/44 and other source N losses must not exceed that stage's available N, after accounting for stocks and transfers. Bound each indirect N2O-N calculation by its documented volatilised or leached N precursor, not by subtracting that downstream transformation again from the source ledger. These are conservation checks, not emission factors or an empirical per-product range.| `cp_pathway_emissions` | kg named compound per final reference flow | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |
| `calc_feed_supply_and_intake` | `feed` | Feed supply used by the represented operation = opening feed stock + receipts + on-site feed entering the operation - closing feed stock - documented unused returns or transfers out. Retain in-boundary spoilage, refusals and discarded leftovers in that supply. Actual intake = that supply - measured uneaten/discarded losses, after matching moisture/DM and period; use intake only for nutrition/metabolism. Opening stock retains its prior burden and is not another purchase. Trace any unused return or transfer and its burden destination; no automatic substitution credit. Attribute production once, through either the purchased-feed dataset or the represented on-site crop/collection node, never both for the same feed. Include actual waste treatment and manure contributions once, not as a second feed-production burden. | `cp_feed_supply_and_intake` | separate feed supply, intake and loss quantities, in matched as-fed/DM units | `fao-feed-loss-accounting-2018` |
| `calc_manure_n2o_coverage` | `review_laying_direct_n2o`; `review_laying_indirect_n2o` | For each actual manure stage, calculate direct N2O, volatilisation/deposition-derived indirect N2O, and applicable leaching/runoff-derived indirect N2O separately with documented species/system activity and factor basis. Convert N2O-N to molecular N2O by 44/28 once; do not reconvert molecular masses. Retain component worksheets. Where an existing N2O card covers both direct and indirect emissions, report their non-overlapping sum; where separate direct/indirect cards exist, assign each component once to its matching card and never also report the sum. Pasture deposition and land application use the managed-soil method, not a manure-storage factor. Assign foreground versus linked treatment/pasture coverage explicitly; a manure export does not erase earlier emissions, and already covered downstream emissions are not repeated. Account for stock, transfers and previous N losses in the nitrogen cascade; indirect N2O is a downstream transformation of its precursor, not a second source-stage N loss. Normalize attributed molecular masses once to the accepted reference output. Document inapplicability; absent pathway data are not zero. | `cp_manure_n2o_coverage` | kg molecular N2O by pathway and assigned existing card | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `identity` | reference eggs | Prove non-hen, fresh shell-on, actual non-hatching use and producer gate. | lot transfer ticket |
| `coverage` | nodes | Required nodes complete; activate conditional nodes only from actual operations. | operation log |
| `balance` | eggs/losses | Reconcile count, mass, grade, rejects and stock at each node. | scale and sorting ledger |
| `shared` | periods/assets | Retain flock, period, route and shared-use evidence without duplication. | primary activity record |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `identity_gate` | reference eggs | Require non-hen, fresh shell-on, measured 1 kg, actual non-hatching use and true producer gate; non-food unincubated use remains eligible. | `fao-codex-eggs` |
| `route_gate` | nodes | Laying and independent collection required, sorting/packing evidence-based; species and housing differences change inventory or QA. | `fao-codex-eggs`; `fao-leap-poultry` |
| `grade_gate` | grades | Sorting has at least two real destinations; hatching/processing diversions need suitability and lawful acceptance; broken eggs cannot be reference. | `fao-codex-eggs` |
| `attribution_gate` | co-outputs/periods/assets | Verify each handover, service period and allocated total without node/period duplication. | `fao-leap-poultry` |
| `uuid_gate` | concrete downstream exchanges | Verify each UUID, property and unit before downstream TIDAS process; do not force blanks. | `fao-leap-poultry` |
| `v_pathway_emission_coverage` | `laying` | Require a pathway coverage ledger for enteric CH4 where biologically applicable, manure CH4, direct/indirect N2O, NH3 and relevant field emissions. Every pathway needs a measured/calculated value, a named linked process with matching coverage, or supported inapplicability; absent data cannot become zero. Keep wild life before capture outside managed husbandry, assess actual managed holding separately, and retain species-specific evidence. | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023` |
| `v_foreground_emission_responsibility` | Actual operated nodes and linked services | Record responsibility for on-site fuel combustion and refrigerant leakage when applicable: either quantified foreground emissions or a named linked process explicitly covering them, never merely a fuel-supply or electricity-production input. Assess special-taxon biological and residue emissions using species/route evidence, without a generic livestock factor. Identify any unresolved pathway and withhold a completeness claim; document supported absence and prevent duplicate upstream/downstream accounting. | |
| `v_feed_supply_intake_separation` | All feed inputs | Reject an upstream feed inventory reduced by in-boundary refusal, spoilage or discarded leftovers without retaining their production burden. Reconcile supply, intake, stock, transfers and loss destinations under calc_feed_supply_and_intake. Do not reuse intake as supplied feed, assume zero-burden on-site feed or grant automatic avoided-product credits. | `fao-feed-loss-accounting-2018` |
| `v_manure_n2o_coverage` | Applicable manure and managed-soil N pathways | Require explicit direct and indirect pathway coverage, stage N balances and molecular-mass conversion. Map each component to an existing N2O card or an explicitly covering linked process once under calc_manure_n2o_coverage. Missing indirect-pathway evidence prevents a completeness claim; no default zero or duplicate aggregate-plus-components. | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |

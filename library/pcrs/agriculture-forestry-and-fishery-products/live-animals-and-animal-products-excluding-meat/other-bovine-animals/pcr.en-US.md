# Other bovine animals, live

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers a living, species-qualified member of Bovinae that remains outside the separately named cattle (*Bos*) and buffalo/bison (*Bubalus*, *Syncerus*, *Bison*) categories, and is accepted into the residual bovine class only after a documented classification decision. Nilgai (*Boselaphus tragocamelus*) is a conditional example: ITIS places it in Bovinae, while the UN does not expressly list it under CPC 02119 and also mentions antelopes under residual ruminants 02129. A concrete lot must document the taxon, CPC/HS reasoning, legal source, condition and actual live handover; it must not be counted in both 02119 and 02129. Taxonomy or a movement rule alone is not a permit. Exclude dead animals, meat, hides, research capture followed by release, and buyer transport after the declared gate.

## 2. Product Category Identity

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Living residual bovine of one declared species and source route |
| How much | 1 kg measured live body mass plus head count and individual or lot mass record |
| How well | Species/taxon, age/sex class, viability, health, ownership/custody and legal source verified |
| How long or cycle | Actual cohort and service periods for managed stock, or actual authorized capture campaign |
| reference_flow_link | `live_output` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Species-, source- and gate-qualified living other bovine |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `m_live_mass` | Every live transfer and reference | Mass | kg | Record measured live mass and count at each real handover; never use a universal kg/head factor. |
| `m_period` | Cohorts, capture and shared assets | Time | declared day or period | Link actual inputs, mortality, movements and output to unique cohort/campaign and service periods. |
| `m_balance` | Live-animal ledger | Count and Mass | head and kg | Reconcile opening/purchased animals, births or captures, deaths, live transfers and closing stock without double counting. |
| `inventory_reference_normalization` | all inventory rows | Actual flow property | exchange unit per reference flow | The inventory and collection aggregation fields below express final amounts per declared reference flow. Keep all raw collection records, original denominator qualifiers, route/period strata, unit conversions and allocation requirements. For each flow, first obtain its attributable amount in its own numerator unit using the existing rules; then divide by the measured accepted reference-output quantity of the same scope and multiply by the declared reference quantity. Do not mix species, states, gates or incompatible routes; count transfers and shared burdens once. A missing, zero or untraceable accepted-output denominator is a blocking data-quality issue. Keep provisional QA ranges on their explicitly stated bases; they are not conversion factors or production defaults. Compute normalized amount = attributable amount * declared reference quantity / measured accepted reference-output quantity. Apply normalization once only; never divide an already normalized value again. |
| `stage_throughput_linkage` | stage records and final package contributions | Actual flow property and its stated raw basis | retain native numerator and stage denominator units | Keep the original lot, event, cohort, period and stage denominators with their units. Reconstruct the attributable numerator A with measured stage quantity Q_stage and documented attribution before final normalization. If a quoted amount a_B corresponds to an explicit stage basis B_stage (for example, 1000 kg), use A = a_B * Q_stage / B_stage. If r_stage is already an intensity in exchange-unit per stage-unit, instead use A = r_stage * Q_stage, with no second division by B_stage. A raw attributable total is used directly. Final contribution = A * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final output. Convert compatible units explicitly and apply each attribution/allocation share exactly once; never treat a quoted amount or intensity as a raw total. Link stage transfers, losses, rejects, stocks, shared services and allocation to the same actual route, period and final-output stratum. For a 1000 kg basis retain 1000 kg explicitly. Do not assume unit yield, equal fresh/dried mass, equal head mass, equal dose quality or interchangeable gates. Missing links, unsupported unit conversion, zero denominators and untraceable allocation block dataset production. Stage-native datasets retain their own stage reference; package contributions are a separate projection. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Managed route: documented opening herd or purchased breeding/young stock with prior burden. Capture route: specific authorized free-ranging source and campaign, without fictional lifetime husbandry. |
| starting_condition_role | Managed biological stock or lawful capture context; purchased animals are Product inputs with upstream burden. |
| product_classification_scope | Species-qualified live residual Bovinae after exclusions and explicit resolution of nilgai/other antelope overlap with 02129. |
| recursive_input_rule | Link purchased same-category live animals once to their preceding-gate dataset; internal live transfers are not another final product. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Match purchased stock, feed, supplied water, energy and services to supplier, material identity, geography, unit and gate; retain source/custody and movement permissions. |
| disclosure | Taxon and CPC decision, legal source, route, cohort/campaign, measured count/mass, losses, service periods, actual handover and unresolved identities. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `b_class` | Every lot | Establish Bovinae membership and exclusion from named cattle/buffalo genera; document why an antelope-labelled species is not assigned to 02129. A nilgai example is an inference, not explicit UN placement. | `un-cpc3-2025`; `itis-nilgai`; `un-cpc21-2015` |
| `b_managed` | Managed source | Record real breeding/rearing, purchased-stock burden, husbandry and herd-period changes through the live transfer to gate. | `fws-nilgai-zoo-2019` |
| `b_capture` | Authorized capture source | A separate capture node requires actual legal authority, campaign, viable captured animals and destination handover; research tagging followed by release is outside the marketed reference. | `usda-nilgai-capture-2023`; `tahc-exotics-movement` |
| `b_gate` | Both routes | Stop at one real live source handover; exclude slaughter, carcass products and downstream buyer transport. | `un-cpc3-2025`; `nandankanan-nilgai-exchange`; `tahc-exotics-movement` |
| `b_shared` | Facilities and equipment | Assign shared enclosure, water or handling service only to actual consuming nodes and periods, once. | `fws-nilgai-zoo-2019` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `managed` | Breed and rear eligible residual bovines | conditional | Documented managed stock and actual husbandry | Biological production and live stock handoff | per kg accepted live output |
| `capture` | Independently capture and briefly hold eligible residual bovines | conditional | Actual authorized campaign with live transfer; exclusive of managed source | Capture, welfare and loss handoff | per kg accepted live output |
| `gate` | Select, weigh and hand over living bovines | required | One actual producer/capture source gate | Live acceptance and reference output | per kg accepted live output |

Managed breeding is evidenced by captive nilgai births; capture is independently evidenced for nilgai research, but a research capture-and-release is **not** a product route. The capture process below is available only for an authorized actual live transfer. Each lot uses one source route. Unperformed inputs are zero only with documented non-use. A separate independently transferred by-product is not presumed; if one exists, identify its own flow and attribution before instantiating a dataset. Mortalities and manure are not live product.

##### Elementary flows

###### Enteric biogenic methane to air (`review_managed_enteric_ch4`)

Only for an applicable digestive pathway of the actual managed species and class; derive emissions from documented animal activity/intake and a justified method. Do not substitute a cattle factor for an uncharacterised species. Applies only to the operated `managed` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

- Selected flow: Methane, biogenic, to air (UUID unresolved)

###### Manure biogenic methane to air (`review_managed_manure_ch4`)

Calculate actual atmospheric release by manure system, climate, residence time and volatile-solids activity. Reconcile captured, destroyed or oxidised methane; produced methane is not automatically emitted methane. Applies only to the operated `managed` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

###### Direct manure nitrous oxide to air (`review_managed_direct_n2o`)

Use the actual manure-management nitrogen pathway. Keep storage/treatment distinct from field application and grazing deposition, which require a managed-soil method and an explicitly assigned inventory responsibility. Applies only to the operated `managed` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

###### Indirect manure nitrogen-derived nitrous oxide to air (`review_managed_indirect_n2o`)

Calculate attributable indirect N2O from documented manure N volatilisation/deposition and leaching/runoff pathways where applicable. Keep separate from direct N2O and reconcile any nitrogen-fate calculation already included downstream or in the chosen background/impact model. Applies only to the operated `managed` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete.

###### Manure ammonia to air (`review_managed_nh3`)

Use actual species, housing/storage conditions and a justified nitrogen-flow method. Track total N and ammoniacal N by stage; a generic volatilised-N estimate is not automatically NH3 because it may include other nitrogen species. Applies only to the operated `managed` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a_live_only` | Source and gate | The declared baseline has one intended live product; do not allocate mortality, discarded manure or research releases as co-products. An independently sold additional product requires its own measured exchange and explicit new attribution decision. | `fws-nilgai-zoo-2019` |
| `a_period` | Managed cohorts and capture campaigns | Attribute opening stock, inputs, losses, replacements and accepted animals to the actual cohort/campaign and reporting period; do not amortize by an assumed universal lifetime. | `fws-nilgai-zoo-2019`; `usda-nilgai-capture-2023` |
| `a_shared` | Enclosure, water and handling assets | Attribute each shared facility/service across actual consuming source and gate nodes and service periods using recorded use; charge once. | `fws-nilgai-zoo-2019` |
| `a_transfer` | Live movements | Internal source-to-gate transfer and any return are balance entries, never an additional final output. | |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `c_reference` | Final live gate | Sum measured accepted live kg at one gate, divide each in-boundary amount by that sum, and verify count/mass ledger closure. | `cp_animals`; `cp_capture`; `cp_losses` | amount per kg accepted living output | `tahc-exotics-movement` |
| `c_shared` | Shared services | Assign recorded service to actual consuming node and period once, then normalize; retain the evidence for denominator and period. | `cp_inputs`; `cp_animals` | attributed service per kg live output | |
| `calc_pathway_emissions` | `managed` | Use species- and management-compatible methods and retain disaggregated pathway totals. Convert N2O-N to N2O by 44/28 and NH3-N to NH3 by 17/14 exactly once; already molecular masses are not reconverted. Check methane against the documented available-carbon/methane-potential balance and nitrogen losses against each stage's available N. Indirect formation from previously volatilised N is a downstream transformation, not a second source-stage N loss. Attribute and normalize once; do not duplicate linked treatment or fate-model emissions.  Use matched raw-period quantities before allocation for physical screens: CH4 mass × 12/16 must not exceed the carbon available to the represented pathway; source-stage NH3 mass × 14/17 plus direct N2O mass × 28/44 and other source N losses must not exceed that stage's available N, after accounting for stocks and transfers. Bound each indirect N2O-N calculation by its documented volatilised or leached N precursor, not by subtracting that downstream transformation again from the source ledger. These are conservation checks, not emission factors or an empirical per-product range.| `cp_pathway_emissions` | kg named compound per final reference flow | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |
| `calc_feed_supply_and_intake` | `managed_feed` | Feed supply used by the represented operation = opening feed stock + receipts + on-site feed entering the operation - closing feed stock - documented unused returns or transfers out. Retain in-boundary spoilage, refusals and discarded leftovers in that supply. Actual intake = that supply - measured uneaten/discarded losses, after matching moisture/DM and period; use intake only for nutrition/metabolism. Opening stock retains its prior burden and is not another purchase. Trace any unused return or transfer and its burden destination; no automatic substitution credit. Attribute production once, through either the purchased-feed dataset or the represented on-site crop/collection node, never both for the same feed. Include actual waste treatment and manure contributions once, not as a second feed-production burden. | `cp_feed_supply_and_intake` | separate feed supply, intake and loss quantities, in matched as-fed/DM units | `fao-feed-loss-accounting-2018` |
| `calc_manure_n2o_coverage` | `review_managed_direct_n2o`; `review_managed_indirect_n2o` | For each actual manure stage, calculate direct N2O, volatilisation/deposition-derived indirect N2O, and applicable leaching/runoff-derived indirect N2O separately with documented species/system activity and factor basis. Convert N2O-N to molecular N2O by 44/28 once; do not reconvert molecular masses. Retain component worksheets. Where an existing N2O card covers both direct and indirect emissions, report their non-overlapping sum; where separate direct/indirect cards exist, assign each component once to its matching card and never also report the sum. Pasture deposition and land application use the managed-soil method, not a manure-storage factor. Assign foreground versus linked treatment/pasture coverage explicitly; a manure export does not erase earlier emissions, and already covered downstream emissions are not repeated. Account for stock, transfers and previous N losses in the nitrogen cascade; indirect N2O is a downstream transformation of its precursor, not a second source-stage N loss. Normalize attributed molecular masses once to the accepted reference output. Document inapplicability; absent pathway data are not zero. | `cp_manure_n2o_coverage` | kg molecular N2O by pathway and assigned existing card | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dq_class` | Every lot | Prove taxon and residual 02119 classification against 02111/02112/02129; do not rely on common name alone. | taxonomic record; classification decision |
| `dq_legal` | Every lot | Prove source, custody, movement/capture authority and recipient; research release is not a marketed output. | permits; source and handover records |
| `dq_mass` | Reference and transfers | Measure live mass and count, reconcile returns and deaths, do not assume kg/head. | weigh tickets; animal register |
| `dq_period` | Cohort/campaign and assets | Cover full reporting period and assign shared burden once. | service and event ledger |
| `dq_uuid` | Final exchange | Verify exact flow, property and unit group before downstream TIDAS exchange publication. | platform detail and support-row evidence |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v_class` | Every dataset | Reject missing species, unreasoned overlap with 02129, or an animal already covered as cattle/buffalo/bison. | `un-cpc3-2025`; `itis-nilgai`; `un-cpc21-2015` |
| `v_route` | Every lot | Require exactly one source route with actual legal authority and living transfer; exclude capture-and-release from product output. | `usda-nilgai-capture-2023`; `tahc-exotics-movement` |
| `v_balance` | Stock and outputs | Reconcile head count and mass from opening/purchased/captured stock through births, transfers, returns, deaths and closing stock; only accepted live output is reference. | |
| `v_period` | Assets and cohorts | Require real service periods, consumers and once-only shared attribution; no assumed universal lifetime or capture yield. | |
| `v_identity` | Unbound cards | Leave unconfirmed UUIDs blank; final concrete exchange needs exact flow, property and unit-group evidence. | |
| `v_pathway_emission_coverage` | `managed` | Require a pathway coverage ledger for enteric CH4 where biologically applicable, manure CH4, direct/indirect N2O, NH3 and relevant field emissions. Every pathway needs a measured/calculated value, a named linked process with matching coverage, or supported inapplicability; absent data cannot become zero. Keep wild life before capture outside managed husbandry, assess actual managed holding separately, and retain species-specific evidence. | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023` |
| `v_foreground_emission_responsibility` | Actual operated nodes and linked services | Record responsibility for on-site fuel combustion and refrigerant leakage when applicable: either quantified foreground emissions or a named linked process explicitly covering them, never merely a fuel-supply or electricity-production input. Assess special-taxon biological and residue emissions using species/route evidence, without a generic livestock factor. Identify any unresolved pathway and withhold a completeness claim; document supported absence and prevent duplicate upstream/downstream accounting. | |
| `v_feed_supply_intake_separation` | All feed inputs | Reject an upstream feed inventory reduced by in-boundary refusal, spoilage or discarded leftovers without retaining their production burden. Reconcile supply, intake, stock, transfers and loss destinations under calc_feed_supply_and_intake. Do not reuse intake as supplied feed, assume zero-burden on-site feed or grant automatic avoided-product credits. | `fao-feed-loss-accounting-2018` |
| `v_manure_n2o_coverage` | Applicable manure and managed-soil N pathways | Require explicit direct and indirect pathway coverage, stage N balances and molecular-mass conversion. Map each component to an existing N2O card or an explicitly covering linked process once under calc_manure_n2o_coverage. Missing indirect-pathway evidence prevents a completeness claim; no default zero or duplicate aggregate-plus-components. | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |

# Other birds, live

## 1. Scope and Applicability

Cover living, species-qualified birds in residual CPC 02194, including pigeons, quail, partridges and pheasants at a documented breeder or lawful capture gate. Birds of prey and psittacines qualify only with species-specific authorization and legitimate provenance. Exclude chickens, turkeys, geese, ducks and guinea fowl; ostriches, emus and rheas; eggs, dead birds, meat and buyer transport. Classification does not grant a protected-species trade permit.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | `pcr.agriculture-forestry-and-fishery-products.live-animals-and-animal-products-excluding-meat.other-birds` |

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `m_live` | Live reference and transfers | Mass | kg | Weigh each actual live lot by species and class, and reconcile count; no universal kg/bird factor. |
| `m_period` | Cohorts, campaigns and shared assets | Time | declared period | Link stock, input, mortality, output and shared service to actual period and phase. |
| `m_energy` | Fuel and electricity cards | Energy or mass | kWh or kg | Keep each actual carrier in its native unit; convert fuel to kWh-equivalent only for the provisional QA screen using a disclosed supplier calorific value, never as an invented fixed exchange. |
| `inventory_reference_normalization` | all inventory rows | Actual flow property | exchange unit per reference flow | The inventory and collection aggregation fields below express final amounts per declared reference flow. Keep all raw collection records, original denominator qualifiers, route/period strata, unit conversions and allocation requirements. For each flow, first obtain its attributable amount in its own numerator unit using the existing rules; then divide by the measured accepted reference-output quantity of the same scope and multiply by the declared reference quantity. Do not mix species, states, gates or incompatible routes; count transfers and shared burdens once. A missing, zero or untraceable accepted-output denominator is a blocking data-quality issue. Keep provisional QA ranges on their explicitly stated bases; they are not conversion factors or production defaults. Compute normalized amount = attributable amount * declared reference quantity / measured accepted reference-output quantity. Apply normalization once only; never divide an already normalized value again. |
| `stage_throughput_linkage` | stage records and final package contributions | Actual flow property and its stated raw basis | retain native numerator and stage denominator units | Keep the original lot, event, cohort, period and stage denominators with their units. Reconstruct the attributable numerator A with measured stage quantity Q_stage and documented attribution before final normalization. If a quoted amount a_B corresponds to an explicit stage basis B_stage (for example, 1000 kg), use A = a_B * Q_stage / B_stage. If r_stage is already an intensity in exchange-unit per stage-unit, instead use A = r_stage * Q_stage, with no second division by B_stage. A raw attributable total is used directly. Final contribution = A * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final output. Convert compatible units explicitly and apply each attribution/allocation share exactly once; never treat a quoted amount or intensity as a raw total. Link stage transfers, losses, rejects, stocks, shared services and allocation to the same actual route, period and final-output stratum. For a 1000 kg basis retain 1000 kg explicitly. Do not assume unit yield, equal fresh/dried mass, equal head mass, equal dose quality or interchangeable gates. Missing links, unsupported unit conversion, zero denominators and untraceable allocation block dataset production. Stage-native datasets retain their own stage reference; package contributions are a separate projection. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Managed route: opening/purchased breeding or young birds and prior burden. Capture route: authorized source campaign, without fictional breeder stock. |
| starting_condition_role | Managed biological stock/upstream Product, or documented lawful capture context. |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0 `02194`, after exclusion of other live-bird classes. |
| recursive_input_rule | Link purchased same-category birds to one upstream dataset; internal transfers are not second sales. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Match purchased birds, feed and energy by supplier, identity, geography and gate; retain capture authorization. |
| disclosure | Species, legal origin, route, count/mass, cohort/campaign, mortality, co-products, gate and shared-service periods. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `b_scope` | Every lot | Verify species, residual classification and lawful source. No protected-species commerce follows from a CPC example. | `un-cpc-2025`; `woah-wildlife-2021` |
| `b_route` | Production source | Managed rearing includes real stock, care and losses; lawful capture includes actual capture, short holding and losses, but no invented breeding. Stop at accepted live source handover. | `un-cpc-2025`; `woah-wildlife-2021` |
| `b_shared` | Shared assets | Attribute aviary, enclosure, water and handling services to actual consuming nodes and periods once; exclude slaughter and buyer transport. | `iso-14044-2006` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rear` | Breed and rear eligible birds | conditional | documented managed source | managed biological production | per kg live-bird handover |
| `capture` | Lawfully capture and briefly hold wild birds | conditional | documented lawful wild source; alternative to rearing | independent live capture | per kg live-bird handover |
| `handover` | Select, weigh and hand over live birds | required | actual source gate | final live acceptance | per kg live-bird handover |

Managed rearing follows breeder stock, feed and period-specific care through live selection; independently sold eggs or feathers are distinct products only at evidenced gates. Lawful capture begins with a documented campaign and live containment, independent of rearing. The final gate checks species, live condition, count and mass. Assign shared aviary or handling infrastructure once by actual node and period.

###### Manure biogenic methane to air (`review_rear_manure_ch4`)

Calculate actual atmospheric release by manure system, climate, residence time and volatile-solids activity. Reconcile captured, destroyed or oxidised methane; produced methane is not automatically emitted methane. Applies only to the operated `rear` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

- Selected flow: Methane, biogenic, to air (UUID unresolved)
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg CH4
- Amount rule: Calculate the pathway total for this node and period, apply the existing allocation and stage_throughput_linkage, then inventory_reference_normalization exactly once to the measured final accepted reference output.
- Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`)
- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)

###### Direct manure nitrous oxide to air (`review_rear_direct_n2o`)

Use the actual manure-management nitrogen pathway. Keep storage/treatment distinct from field application and grazing deposition, which require a managed-soil method and an explicitly assigned inventory responsibility. Applies only to the operated `rear` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

- Selected flow: Nitrous oxide to air (UUID unresolved)
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg N2O
- Amount rule: Calculate the pathway total for this node and period, apply the existing allocation and stage_throughput_linkage, then inventory_reference_normalization exactly once to the measured final accepted reference output.

###### Indirect manure nitrogen-derived nitrous oxide to air (`review_rear_indirect_n2o`)

Calculate attributable indirect N2O from documented manure N volatilisation/deposition and leaching/runoff pathways where applicable. Keep separate from direct N2O and reconcile any nitrogen-fate calculation already included downstream or in the chosen background/impact model. Applies only to the operated `rear` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

###### Manure ammonia to air (`review_rear_nh3`)

Use actual species, housing/storage conditions and a justified nitrogen-flow method. Track total N and ammoniacal N by stage; a generic volatilised-N estimate is not automatically NH3 because it may include other nitrogen species. Applies only to the operated `rear` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

- Selected flow: Ammonia to air (UUID unresolved)

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a_outputs` | Independent product sales | Distinguish live birds from independently sold eggs or feathers at their own gate. Prefer process separation and causal attribution; if inseparable, allocate shared burdens by measured same-period economic value with price evidence.

| `a_period` | Cohorts and campaigns | Attribute stock, replacement, input and output to observed cohort/campaign and service period; reconcile opening/closing stock and never charge replacement twice. | `iso-14044-2006` |
| `a_shared` | Shared assets and services | Allocate common aviary, water or handling service by metered consumption or measured use time for each node and period; disclose any proxy and prevent a second charge. | `iso-14044-2006` |

| `cp_pathway_emissions` | `rear` | pathway-specific gases and manure N/C | herd, feed, manure, field and method ledger | species/class; animal-days; intake/DM/digestibility; volatile solids; manure N/TAN; system shares; climate; storage time; fertiliser N; grazing; volatilisation/leaching; methane recovery; factor source/unit; final accepted output ; collected manure wet mass; dry matter; destination| collect primary activity by node and period, document parameter applicability, retain each pathway worksheet and any linked treatment/pasture dataset  Retain raw totals and normalize attributed quantities once to the measured accepted final reference output.| animal-day; kg DM; kg VS; kg N; kg CH4; kg N2O; kg NH3 | each operating period and management change | complete represented cohort and service period | actual operated nodes only | per reference flow | meter/analysis records, nitrogen cascade, method and factor evidence, no-duplication ledger |
| `cp_feed_supply_and_intake` | `rear` | Feed supply, intake and loss | stock, receipt, issue and loss ledger | feed identity/source; cohort/phase; period; opening/closing stock; receipts; on-site provision; unused returns/transfers; uneaten/spoiled mass and destination; as-fed/DM; actual intake; burden owner; accepted final output | Reconcile matched stock, scales, ration/forage estimates and disposal records under calc_feed_supply_and_intake.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `c_balance` | Source and handover | Reconcile opening + born/purchased/captured - released - dead - closing = transferred count, by species and period; reconcile measured mass separately. | dated cohort/campaign and scale records | count and mass balance | `woah-transport` |
| `c_normalize` | Each inventory | Divide attributed input or output by accepted live kg; never use a species-free kg/bird conversion. | attributed amount and accepted mass | per kg live output | `iso-14044-2006` |
| `c_shared` | Shared service | Sum node/period shares to the one measured total; no duplicate service attribution. | meter and use ledger | attributed service | `iso-14044-2006` |
| `calc_pathway_emissions` | `rear` | Use species- and management-compatible methods and retain disaggregated pathway totals. Convert N2O-N to N2O by 44/28 and NH3-N to NH3 by 17/14 exactly once; already molecular masses are not reconverted. Check methane against the documented available-carbon/methane-potential balance and nitrogen losses against each stage's available N. Indirect formation from previously volatilised N is a downstream transformation, not a second source-stage N loss. Attribute and normalize once; do not duplicate linked treatment or fate-model emissions.  Use matched raw-period quantities before allocation for physical screens: CH4 mass × 12/16 must not exceed the carbon available to the represented pathway; source-stage NH3 mass × 14/17 plus direct N2O mass × 28/44 and other source N losses must not exceed that stage's available N, after accounting for stocks and transfers. Bound each indirect N2O-N calculation by its documented volatilised or leached N precursor, not by subtracting that downstream transformation again from the source ledger. These are conservation checks, not emission factors or an empirical per-product range.| `cp_pathway_emissions` | kg named compound per final reference flow | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |
| `calc_feed_supply_and_intake` | `rear_feed` | Feed supply used by the represented operation = opening feed stock + receipts + on-site feed entering the operation - closing feed stock - documented unused returns or transfers out. Retain in-boundary spoilage, refusals and discarded leftovers in that supply. Actual intake = that supply - measured uneaten/discarded losses, after matching moisture/DM and period; use intake only for nutrition/metabolism. Opening stock retains its prior burden and is not another purchase. Trace any unused return or transfer and its burden destination; no automatic substitution credit. Attribute production once, through either the purchased-feed dataset or the represented on-site crop/collection node, never both for the same feed. Include actual waste treatment and manure contributions once, not as a second feed-production burden. | `cp_feed_supply_and_intake` | separate feed supply, intake and loss quantities, in matched as-fed/DM units | `fao-feed-loss-accounting-2018` |
| `calc_manure_n2o_coverage` | `review_rear_direct_n2o`; `review_rear_indirect_n2o` | For each actual manure stage, calculate direct N2O, volatilisation/deposition-derived indirect N2O, and applicable leaching/runoff-derived indirect N2O separately with documented species/system activity and factor basis. Convert N2O-N to molecular N2O by 44/28 once; do not reconvert molecular masses. Retain component worksheets. Where an existing N2O card covers both direct and indirect emissions, report their non-overlapping sum; where separate direct/indirect cards exist, assign each component once to its matching card and never also report the sum. Pasture deposition and land application use the managed-soil method, not a manure-storage factor. Assign foreground versus linked treatment/pasture coverage explicitly; a manure export does not erase earlier emissions, and already covered downstream emissions are not repeated. Account for stock, transfers and previous N losses in the nitrogen cascade; indirect N2O is a downstream transformation of its precursor, not a second source-stage N loss. Normalize attributed molecular masses once to the accepted reference output. Document inapplicability; absent pathway data are not zero. | `cp_manure_n2o_coverage` | kg molecular N2O by pathway and assigned existing card | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `q_species` | Each lot | Identify species, residual code and legitimate source before inventory assembly. | species and custody/permit record |
| `q_live` | Reference | Accepted output must be alive and have reconciled count and measured mass. | scale, health and mortality logs |
| `q_period` | Multi-period and shared service | Explain stock changes, phase boundaries and shared-use fractions. | cohort/campaign and service ledgers |
| `q_identity` | Concrete exchange | Resolve each unbound card or unresolved input to compatible, verified flow/property/unit identity before release. | candidate/detail/support verification |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v_scope` | Every lot | Reject separated poultry/ratites, dead output, missing species or source, and unauthorized protected-species trade. | `un-cpc-2025`; `woah-wildlife-2021` |
| `v_balance` | Source and gate | Reconcile birds born, purchased, captured, released, transferred, dead and closing by species and period; no internal transfer as second sale. | `woah-transport` |
| `v_outputs` | Multi-output cohort | Check independent product gates, allocation method, period alignment and no allocation to waste. | `iso-14044-2006` |
| `v_shared` | Shared service | Check actual consumers, periods and fraction sum against one measured burden. | `iso-14044-2006` |
| `v_binding` | Concrete exchange | No unresolved UUID or conditional flow identities alone is a final flow identity; verify type, species/state, property/unit and gate. | `un-cpc-2025` |
| `v_pathway_emission_coverage` | `rear` | Require a pathway coverage ledger for enteric CH4 where biologically applicable, manure CH4, direct/indirect N2O, NH3 and relevant field emissions. Every pathway needs a measured/calculated value, a named linked process with matching coverage, or supported inapplicability; absent data cannot become zero. Keep wild life before capture outside managed husbandry, assess actual managed holding separately, and retain species-specific evidence. | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023` |
| `v_foreground_emission_responsibility` | Actual operated nodes and linked services | Record responsibility for on-site fuel combustion and refrigerant leakage when applicable: either quantified foreground emissions or a named linked process explicitly covering them, never merely a fuel-supply or electricity-production input. Assess special-taxon biological and residue emissions using species/route evidence, without a generic livestock factor. Identify any unresolved pathway and withhold a completeness claim; document supported absence and prevent duplicate upstream/downstream accounting. | |
| `v_feed_supply_intake_separation` | All feed inputs | Reject an upstream feed inventory reduced by in-boundary refusal, spoilage or discarded leftovers without retaining their production burden. Reconcile supply, intake, stock, transfers and loss destinations under calc_feed_supply_and_intake. Do not reuse intake as supplied feed, assume zero-burden on-site feed or grant automatic avoided-product credits. | `fao-feed-loss-accounting-2018` |
| `v_manure_n2o_coverage` | Applicable manure and managed-soil N pathways | Require explicit direct and indirect pathway coverage, stage N balances and molecular-mass conversion. Map each component to an existing N2O card or an explicitly covering linked process once under calc_manure_n2o_coverage. Missing indirect-pathway evidence prevents a completeness claim; no default zero or duplicate aggregate-plus-components. | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |

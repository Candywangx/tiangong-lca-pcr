# Rabbits and hares

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers living domestic rabbits (*Oryctolagus cuniculus*) produced under managed husbandry and living hares (*Lepus* spp.) delivered after demonstrably lawful live capture. It excludes dead animals, meat, fur, hides, slaughter and downstream use. Wild-hare capture is not presumed lawful or representative: declare jurisdiction, permit, welfare controls, capture lot and real handover; absent such evidence do not claim that route. A wild hare is not modelled as a farm product.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | `pcr.agriculture-forestry-and-fishery-products.live-animals-and-animal-products-excluding-meat.rabbits-and-hares` |
| classification_refs | CPC 3.0 `02191`, Rabbits and hares |
| covered_products | Living domestic rabbits and living hares at legitimate actual handover |
| excluded_products | Dead animals, meat, fur, hides, slaughter, trapping service and downstream use |
| representative_product | Living rabbit or hare by measured live mass, with species and gate disclosed |
| production_route | Managed domestic-rabbit breeding and rearing followed by farm live selection; cage versus floor/litter housing are managed-biological parent variants with different bedding, cleaning, energy and manure collection. Separately, lawful live-hare capture is capture-only, with short handling and capture handover, never a managed-production child. Farm and capture routes are mutually exclusive per lot; housing variants may coexist across farm periods. |
| market_state | Alive and unprocessed, with species, class, count, condition and gate declared |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Living rabbit or hare at legitimate producing-farm or capture handover |
| How much | 1 kg measured live mass, with head count and class-specific mass |
| How well | Alive, unprocessed and species-resolved; disclose class and condition |
| How long or cycle | Declared breeding/rearing cohort or lawful capture campaign and actual service periods |
| reference_flow_link | `reference_product_handover` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Living rabbit or hare at farm or lawful capture handover |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | Species; domestic or wild; age/class; head count; condition; measured live mass; route; actual gate; jurisdiction and permit for capture; period |

Instantiate one foreground reference from the actual handed-over lot, with all required qualifiers. The category may cover alternative states and producer gates, but each package has one declared species/state/gate/grade stratum and one measured accepted reference-output denominator. Do not pool incompatible states or claim equal service from equal mass. Route-specific source rows and reference_handover describe the same physical boundary event; their linked internal transfer is not another sale or another physical operation.

The confirmed platform Product identity is farm-gate production mix only and cannot describe the broad farm-or-capture reference.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | Final living output and incoming stock | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh lots or document class-specific sample weights and reconcile count; never assume one animal has a fixed mass. |
| `animal_ledger` | All animal lots | Count | head | Reconcile opening, births or capture, purchase, transfer, release, death and handover by species, class and period. |
| `period_basis` | Breeders, replacement and assets | Time | days or cycle | Link gestation, lactation, weaning, rearing, replacement and shared service to benefited periods; use actual capture service days. |
| `manure_basis` | Collected manure | Mass | kg | Report exported product and waste on consistent as-received or moisture-corrected basis; deposits are not exported product. |
| `inventory_reference_normalization` | all inventory rows | Actual flow property | exchange unit per reference flow | The inventory and collection aggregation fields below express final amounts per declared reference flow. Keep all raw collection records, original denominator qualifiers, route/period strata, unit conversions and allocation requirements. For each flow, first obtain its attributable amount in its own numerator unit using the existing rules; then divide by the measured accepted reference-output quantity of the same scope and multiply by the declared reference quantity. Do not mix species, states, gates or incompatible routes; count transfers and shared burdens once. A missing, zero or untraceable accepted-output denominator is a blocking data-quality issue. Keep provisional QA ranges on their explicitly stated bases; they are not conversion factors or production defaults. These are final foreground-package contributions, not replacements for stage quantitative references or stage-native unit-process datasets. Retain stage records separately. Compute normalized amount = attributable raw amount * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final reference-output quantity. Apply normalization exactly once. |
| `stage_throughput_linkage` | stage records and final package contributions | Actual flow property and its stated raw basis | retain native numerator and stage denominator units | Keep the original lot, event, cohort, period and stage denominators with their units. Reconstruct the attributable numerator A with measured stage quantity Q_stage and documented attribution before final normalization. If a quoted amount a_B corresponds to an explicit stage basis B_stage (for example, 1000 kg), use A = a_B * Q_stage / B_stage. If r_stage is already an intensity in exchange-unit per stage-unit, instead use A = r_stage * Q_stage, with no second division by B_stage. A raw attributable total is used directly. Final contribution = A * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final output. Convert compatible units explicitly and apply each attribution/allocation share exactly once; never treat a quoted amount or intensity as a raw total. Link stage transfers, losses, rejects, stocks, shared services and allocation to the same actual route, period and final-output stratum. For a 1000 kg basis retain 1000 kg explicitly. Do not assume unit yield, equal fresh/dried mass, equal head mass, equal dose quality or interchangeable gates. Missing links, unsupported unit conversion, zero denominators and untraceable allocation block dataset production. Stage-native datasets retain their own stage reference; package contributions are a separate projection. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Domestic opening breeders or purchased young stock with origin/prior burden, or documented lawful pre-capture campaign condition |
| starting_condition_role | Managed stock or lawful capture context; purchased rabbit is not zero burden |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0 `02191` living rabbits and hares |
| recursive_input_rule | Link purchased same-category rabbits once to a preceding-gate dataset; internal weanling transfer is not a second final product. Do not assign wild pre-capture animals fictional farm production. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Match purchased animals, feed, bedding, water, energy and services to real supplier, property, gate and geography. |
| disclosure | Species and domestic/wild state, housing mode or capture permit/site, gate, cohort/campaign, shared assets, product and mortality/manure destinations. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_live` | Both routes | End with a living animal at the real handover; exclude slaughter, meat, hides, fur and downstream use. | `un-cpc-2025` |
| `boundary_farm` | Managed domestic rabbits | Include breeder/rearing stock, feed, water, housing, health and manure only where operated; purchases retain upstream burden. | `fao-rabbit-production`; `fao-rabbit-housing` |
| `boundary_housing` | Managed housing variants | Rabbit breeding/rearing is the biological parent. Cages versus floor/litter change bedding, cleaning, housing energy and manure handling; record real shares, not universal yields. | `fao-rabbit-housing` |
| `boundary_capture` | Living wild hares | Include only documented lawful live trapping, welfare handling and actual capture handover; no fictitious breeder, feed or farm gate. Missing legal evidence makes the route ineligible. | `vic-hare-control` |
| `boundary_shared` | Shared assets | Attribute sheds, feeders, water systems, traps and vehicles once over consuming nodes and service periods; avoid duplicate transfers. | `fao-rabbit-housing`; `vic-hare-control` |
| `reference_handover_linkage` | actual reference-product boundary | Record reference_handover as the same physical producer handover already represented by its source rows. It must not extend the gate or insert new processing, capture, storage, transport, service or capital burdens. For a unit-process projection, keep the actually operated stage references; the handover record may be a boundary interface in the resulting foreground package, not an invented standalone operation. Select one actual qualified route/output stratum; trace matching source and input as internal transfers and expose the accepted reference product once. If the source already ended at this gate, partition its existing handover responsibility without counting it again. |  |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `breeder` | Maintain domestic breeding stock and produce live kits | conditional | Operated breeding farm | Biological production, gestation, lactation, survival and replacement | per kg live weanlings leaving breeder |
| `rearing` | Rear domestic rabbits to producer class | conditional | Operated grow-out; otherwise purchased stock has upstream burden | Biological growth with housing-specific inputs and manure | per kg live rabbits leaving rearing |
| `farm_handover` | Select, weigh and hand over live farm rabbits | conditional | Domestic farm route | Independent collection/health screen and real farm gate | per kg accepted farm-gate live rabbits |
| `hare_capture` | Lawfully capture and hand over living hares | conditional | Verified permit and observed live-capture route | Independent capture-only node and real capture gate | per kg accepted hares at capture handover |
| `reference_handover` | Actual producer reference-product handover | required | One actual declared route, state and producer gate per foreground package | Record the existing physical boundary handover once; linkage/accounting responsibility, not additional treatment or distribution | 1 kg accepted product at the declared handover |

Farm and capture routes are mutually exclusive per animal. Cage and floor/litter modes can coexist by cohort/period. Capture is not a managed-production variant. Live collection is independent of biological growth because acceptance, weighing and handover follow production; losses or releases are not intended live output. Index breeding, weaning, rearing, replacement, asset service and capture events by period.

### Process: Actual producer reference-product handover (`reference_handover`)

Instantiate one foreground reference from the actual handed-over lot, with all required qualifiers. The category may cover alternative states and producer gates, but each package has one declared species/state/gate/grade stratum and one measured accepted reference-output denominator. Do not pool incompatible states or claim equal service from equal mass. Route-specific source rows and reference_handover describe the same physical boundary event; their linked internal transfer is not another sale or another physical operation.

###### Living rabbit or hare at farm or lawful capture handover for actual producer-handover linkage (`reference_handover_input`)

This input matches the accepted goods represented by `live_handover`, `hare_capture_output` under their unchanged route conditions. It is an internal source-to-handover linkage, not a newly purchased same-category good and not extra production. The matching source and input cancel at the package boundary.

The actual route/state/gate is selected from foreground handover evidence; retain every required qualifier. Use the actual terminal source for the same accepted physical lot, not every successive stage transfer. Fixed source identities apply only to their exact species/state/gate; use an unbound compatible source role for other covered routes and resolve the actual foreground exchange before final dataset creation.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `calc_reference` | Both final outputs | Measured accepted live kg / same accepted live kg = 1 kg reference; disclose heads per kg by class. | accepted kg, count, species, class | 1 kg living animal and heads/kg | `un-cpc-2025` |
| `calc_ledger` | Animal stages | Reconcile stock and events without counting internal transfers twice. | opening, births/capture, purchases, release, death, transfer, sale, closing | balanced count and mass | `fao-rabbit-production`; `vic-hare-control` |
| `calc_manure_ch4` | Farm manure | Apply documented applicable livestock/manure method to observed manure and storage/treatment; no universal rabbit factor. | measured manure, route activity and method parameters | kg biogenic CH4 by stage | `ipcc-livestock-2019` |
| `calc_manure_n2o` | Farm manure | Apply pathway-specific direct N2O method to measured manure nitrogen and observed storage/treatment; do not transfer this farm method to wild hare capture. | manure nitrogen, management share, method parameters | kg direct N2O by stage | `ipcc-livestock-2019` |
| `calc_shared` | Shared assets | Allocate one observed burden across recorded consumers/periods; fractions sum to one. | service, animal-days/hours/trips, period | burden by node/cohort | `fao-rabbit-housing`; `vic-hare-control` |
| `calc_feed_input_and_intake` | Feed supply and biological intake | Feed input carrying upstream burden = opening stock + receipts - closing stock - documented unused returns or transfers out. Keep in-boundary spoilage and refusals in that input. Separately derive biological intake = that input - measured uneaten losses, with moisture/DM reconciliation; use intake, not purchased input, in animal metabolism calculations. Record each loss destination and include its treatment or manure contribution once. | `cp_feed` | separate kg feed input, intake and loss by cohort | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `calc_pathway_emissions` | `breeder`; `rearing` | Use species- and management-compatible methods and retain disaggregated pathway totals. Convert N2O-N to N2O by 44/28 and NH3-N to NH3 by 17/14 exactly once; already molecular masses are not reconverted. Check methane against the documented available-carbon/methane-potential balance and nitrogen losses against each stage's available N. Indirect formation from previously volatilised N is a downstream transformation, not a second source-stage N loss. Attribute and normalize once; do not duplicate linked treatment or fate-model emissions.  Use matched raw-period quantities before allocation for physical screens: CH4 mass × 12/16 must not exceed the carbon available to the represented pathway; source-stage NH3 mass × 14/17 plus direct N2O mass × 28/44 and other source N losses must not exceed that stage's available N, after accounting for stocks and transfers. Bound each indirect N2O-N calculation by its documented volatilised or leached N precursor, not by subtracting that downstream transformation again from the source ledger. These are conservation checks, not emission factors or an empirical per-product range.| `cp_pathway_emissions` | kg named compound per final reference flow | `ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |
| `calc_feed_supply_and_intake` | `breeder_feed`; `rearing_feed` | Feed supply used by the represented operation = opening feed stock + receipts + on-site feed entering the operation - closing feed stock - documented unused returns or transfers out. Retain in-boundary spoilage, refusals and discarded leftovers in that supply. Actual intake = that supply - measured uneaten/discarded losses, after matching moisture/DM and period; use intake only for nutrition/metabolism. Opening stock retains its prior burden and is not another purchase. Trace any unused return or transfer and its burden destination; no automatic substitution credit. Attribute production once, through either the purchased-feed dataset or the represented on-site crop/collection node, never both for the same feed. Include actual waste treatment and manure contributions once, not as a second feed-production burden. | `cp_feed_supply_and_intake` | separate feed supply, intake and loss quantities, in matched as-fed/DM units | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `calc_manure_n2o_coverage` | `breeder_manure_n2o`; `review_breeder_indirect_n2o`; `rearing_manure_n2o`; `review_rearing_indirect_n2o` | For each actual manure stage, calculate direct N2O, volatilisation/deposition-derived indirect N2O, and applicable leaching/runoff-derived indirect N2O separately with documented species/system activity and factor basis. Convert N2O-N to molecular N2O by 44/28 once; do not reconvert molecular masses. Retain component worksheets. Where an existing N2O card covers both direct and indirect emissions, report their non-overlapping sum; where separate direct/indirect cards exist, assign each component once to its matching card and never also report the sum. Pasture deposition and land application use the managed-soil method, not a manure-storage factor. Assign foreground versus linked treatment/pasture coverage explicitly; a manure export does not erase earlier emissions, and already covered downstream emissions are not repeated. Account for stock, transfers and previous N losses in the nitrogen cascade; indirect N2O is a downstream transformation of its precursor, not a second source-stage N loss. Normalize attributed molecular masses once to the accepted reference output. Document inapplicability; absent pathway data are not zero. | `cp_manure_n2o_coverage` | kg molecular N2O by pathway and assigned existing card | `ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dq_identity` | Final live output | Distinguish Oryctolagus and Lepus, class, alive state, mass, count and real gate; no meat/slaughter identity. | species ledger and calibrated weight |
| `dq_route` | Farm/capture | Record housing shares; wild capture requires jurisdictional permission and welfare/transport evidence. | husbandry log or permit/campaign log |
| `dq_period` | Multi-period farm/assets | Date breeding, rearing, replacement and asset service; avoid duplicated transfer/asset burdens. | cohort/asset ledger |
| `dq_inventory` | All flows | Reconcile animal, feed, water, material, manure and mortality balances; investigate out-of-screen ranges rather than treating them as defaults. | meters, inventories and transfers |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_species_gate` | Reference/final output | Require species-specific live mass/count at actual farm or lawful capture gate; reject farm-gate UUID on capture and slaughter/meat records. | `un-cpc-2025`; `vic-hare-control` |
| `validate_capture` | Wild hare route | Require observed permit, jurisdiction, capture count, welfare/handling and live handover; missing legal evidence excludes capture route, not replaced by farm production. | `vic-hare-control` |
| `validate_route` | Managed rabbits | Check cage/floor housing, bedding, utilities and manure by cohort; variants may coexist but capture is not a managed parent variant. | `fao-rabbit-housing` |
| `validate_balance` | Outputs/loss | Reconcile weanlings, live breeder culls, final live animals, deaths, released hares, manure product and disposal by distinct gate. | `fao-rabbit-production`; `vic-hare-control` |
| `validate_attribution` | Shared/period burdens | Check output set, handover, allocation method, phase linkage and one-time assignment of sheds, water systems, traps and vehicles. | `fao-rabbit-production`; `fao-rabbit-housing` |
| `validate_ranges` | Inventory cards | Provisional zero-to-upper ranges are QA investigation screens, never assumed amounts or emission factors; replace with measured/reviewed values. | `fao-rabbit-production` |
| `v_feed_loss_burden` | Feed balances | Reject a feed-input inventory that subtracts in-boundary wastage without retaining its upstream burden. Match intake, losses, stocks and unused returns, and document the loss treatment; no automatic co-product credit. | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `v_pathway_emission_coverage` | `breeder`; `rearing` | Require a pathway coverage ledger for enteric CH4 where biologically applicable, manure CH4, direct/indirect N2O, NH3 and relevant field emissions. Every pathway needs a measured/calculated value, a named linked process with matching coverage, or supported inapplicability; absent data cannot become zero. Keep wild life before capture outside managed husbandry, assess actual managed holding separately, and retain species-specific evidence. | `ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023` |
| `v_foreground_emission_responsibility` | Actual operated nodes and linked services | Record responsibility for on-site fuel combustion and refrigerant leakage when applicable: either quantified foreground emissions or a named linked process explicitly covering them, never merely a fuel-supply or electricity-production input. Assess special-taxon biological and residue emissions using species/route evidence, without a generic livestock factor. Identify any unresolved pathway and withhold a completeness claim; document supported absence and prevent duplicate upstream/downstream accounting. | |
| `v_feed_supply_intake_separation` | All feed inputs | Reject an upstream feed inventory reduced by in-boundary refusal, spoilage or discarded leftovers without retaining their production burden. Reconcile supply, intake, stock, transfers and loss destinations under calc_feed_supply_and_intake. Do not reuse intake as supplied feed, assume zero-burden on-site feed or grant automatic avoided-product credits. | `review-fao-pig-lca-2018` |
| `v_manure_n2o_coverage` | Applicable manure and managed-soil N pathways | Require explicit direct and indirect pathway coverage, stage N balances and molecular-mass conversion. Map each component to an existing N2O card or an explicitly covering linked process once under calc_manure_n2o_coverage. Missing indirect-pathway evidence prevents a completeness claim; no default zero or duplicate aggregate-plus-components. | `ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |

# Other ruminants n.e.c., live

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers living, species-qualified residual Ruminantia at actual farm or demonstrably lawful live-capture handover. UN examples include deer, antelopes, serows, gorals, chevrotains and musk deer. Exclude cattle, buffalo, other separately classified bovines, camelids, sheep and goats. An antelope's taxonomic overlap with bovines must be resolved by its actual species, not counted in two categories. A CPC example is never legal authority to capture, breed or trade a protected species. Dead animals, meat, skins, antler products and downstream buyer transport are outside the live reference. No species-free average or universal mass/animal is valid.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | `pcr.agriculture-forestry-and-fishery-products.live-animals-and-animal-products-excluding-meat.other-ruminants-n-e-c` |
| classification_refs | CPC 3.0 `02129` |
| covered_products | Living deer, antelopes, serows, gorals, chevrotains, musk deer or other eligible residual ruminants where species and legal source are proven |
| excluded_products | Separately classified bovines, camelids, sheep, goats; dead animals, meat, skins, detached antlers and downstream transport |
| representative_product | 1 kg measured live mass of one declared eligible species at actual handover |
| production_route | Managed breeding/rearing or documented lawful live capture, mutually exclusive per lot |
| market_state | Alive, unprocessed, species and source legally documented |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | One species-qualified living residual ruminant at actual handover |
| How much | 1 kg measured live mass, with head count and per-head measurements |
| How well | Alive, declared species, sex/age class, health and acceptance condition, lawful origin |
| How long or cycle | Declare farm cohort/breeding season or capture campaign and shared-service periods |
| reference_flow_link | `live_output` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Species-qualified living residual ruminant |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |

| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | Species/taxon; residual classification; legal source and jurisdiction; route; sex/age class; count; live mass; health; gate; cohort/campaign |

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `m_live` | Live reference and transfers | Mass | kg | Weigh living animals at each actual gate and reconcile counts by species and class; never use universal kg/head. |
| `m_period` | Herd, campaign and shared assets | Time | day or declared period | Link inputs, outputs, deaths and shared service to actual cohort, campaign and service period. |
| `inventory_reference_normalization` | all inventory rows | Actual flow property | exchange unit per reference flow | The inventory and collection aggregation fields below express final amounts per declared reference flow. Keep all raw collection records, original denominator qualifiers, route/period strata, unit conversions and allocation requirements. For each flow, first obtain its attributable amount in its own numerator unit using the existing rules; then divide by the measured accepted reference-output quantity of the same scope and multiply by the declared reference quantity. Do not mix species, states, gates or incompatible routes; count transfers and shared burdens once. A missing, zero or untraceable accepted-output denominator is a blocking data-quality issue. Keep provisional QA ranges on their explicitly stated bases; they are not conversion factors or production defaults. Compute normalized amount = attributable amount * declared reference quantity / measured accepted reference-output quantity. Apply normalization once only; never divide an already normalized value again. |
| `stage_throughput_linkage` | stage records and final package contributions | Actual flow property and its stated raw basis | retain native numerator and stage denominator units | Keep the original lot, event, cohort, period and stage denominators with their units. Reconstruct the attributable numerator A with measured stage quantity Q_stage and documented attribution before final normalization. If a quoted amount a_B corresponds to an explicit stage basis B_stage (for example, 1000 kg), use A = a_B * Q_stage / B_stage. If r_stage is already an intensity in exchange-unit per stage-unit, instead use A = r_stage * Q_stage, with no second division by B_stage. A raw attributable total is used directly. Final contribution = A * declared reference quantity / measured accepted final output. Convert compatible units explicitly and apply each attribution/allocation share exactly once; never treat a quoted amount or intensity as a raw total. Link stage transfers, losses, rejects, stocks, shared services and allocation to the same actual route, period and final-output stratum. For a 1000 kg basis retain 1000 kg explicitly. Do not assume unit yield, equal fresh/dried mass, equal head mass, equal dose quality or interchangeable gates. Missing links, unsupported unit conversion, zero denominators and untraceable allocation block dataset production. Stage-native datasets retain their own stage reference; package contributions are a separate projection. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Farm: opening herd or purchased stock with species, class, count, mass and prior burden. Capture: documented lawful campaign and source rights without fictional breeding. |
| starting_condition_role | Farm biological stock or upstream Product input; capture source context, not zero-burden purchased stock |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0 `02129` residual living ruminants after species-level exclusions |
| recursive_input_rule | Link purchased same-category live stock to one upstream producer dataset; internal transfers are not second final output. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Match purchased animals, feed, water, energy and services by supplier, identity, state, geography and gate; retain capture authorization. |
| disclosure | Species, residual decision, legal source, route, cohort/campaign, count/mass, mortality, products, gate and shared-service periods. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `b_species` | Every lot | Species identity and legal source are prerequisites; CPC inclusion is not a trade permit. Resolve bovine overlap explicitly. | `un-cpc-2025`; `woah-wildlife-2021` |
| `b_routes` | Farm or capture | Farm includes real breeding/rearing and purchased-stock burden; capture includes authorized campaign, short holding and losses but no invented lifetime farm. Stop at actual live handover. | `fao-deer-farming`; `woah-wildlife-2021` |
| `b_shared` | Shared facilities | Assign fencing, water/handling services to actual consuming nodes and periods once; exclude slaughter and post-gate buyer journey. | `fao-deer-farming`; `woah-transport` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `herd` | Breed and rear eligible living ruminants | conditional | evidenced managed-farm source | managed biological production | per kg final live output |
| `capture` | Capture and briefly hold eligible living ruminants | conditional | documented lawful source; mutually exclusive with farm | independent capture | per kg final live output |
| `handover` | Select, weigh and hand over living animals | required | actual producer or capture gate | final live acceptance | per kg final live output |

The farm node begins with opening or purchased animals and tracks feed, care, cohort stock change and mortality. Capture begins with real legal rights and a campaign; it never inherits fictional breeding. Handover independently verifies condition, head count, mass and acceptance after either source node. Actual sold antler/velvet, milk, breeding services, usable manure or other products are independent only at documented handover; meat is not produced by live handover. Shared facilities are attributed by actual node and period.

###### Enteric biogenic methane to air (`review_herd_enteric_ch4`)

Only for an applicable digestive pathway of the actual managed species and class; derive emissions from documented animal activity/intake and a justified method. Do not substitute a cattle factor for an uncharacterised species. Applies only to the operated `herd` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

- Selected flow: Methane, biogenic, to air (UUID unresolved)

###### Manure biogenic methane to air (`review_herd_manure_ch4`)

Calculate actual atmospheric release by manure system, climate, residence time and volatile-solids activity. Reconcile captured, destroyed or oxidised methane; produced methane is not automatically emitted methane. Applies only to the operated `herd` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

###### Direct manure nitrous oxide to air (`review_herd_direct_n2o`)

Use the actual manure-management nitrogen pathway. Keep storage/treatment distinct from field application and grazing deposition, which require a managed-soil method and an explicitly assigned inventory responsibility. Applies only to the operated `herd` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

###### Indirect manure nitrogen-derived nitrous oxide to air (`review_herd_indirect_n2o`)

Calculate attributable indirect N2O from documented manure N volatilisation/deposition and leaching/runoff pathways where applicable. Keep separate from direct N2O and reconcile any nitrogen-fate calculation already included downstream or in the chosen background/impact model. Applies only to the operated `herd` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete.

###### Manure ammonia to air (`review_herd_nh3`)

Use actual species, housing/storage conditions and a justified nitrogen-flow method. Track total N and ammoniacal N by stage; a generic volatilised-N estimate is not automatically NH3 because it may include other nitrogen species. Applies only to the operated `herd` node; preserve its existing route and period conditions. A dataset must resolve actual activity, method applicability and an evidence-based range or physical bound for this pathway before treating the inventory as complete. Missing evidence is not zero or not_applicable. A verified substance/origin/compartment UUID is still required for a final bound exchange.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a_outputs` | Farm and capture | Enumerate each independently sold live animal, antler/velvet, milk, breeding service, usable manure or other real product by identity, amount and handover. Internal transfer, hypothetical output, residue and discarded waste have no product credit; substitution is not a silent default. | `fao-deer-farming` |
| `a_joint` | Joint production | Prefer measured process subdivision. Otherwise disclose a justified physical causal allocation tied to actual output and cohort; if none is defensible, report economic sensitivity with contemporaneous prices. | `fao-deer-farming` |
| `a_period` | Herd cohorts or capture campaign | Link breeding, rearing, replacement, deaths, sold outputs and campaign events to actual period; assign opening/closing stock once and never invent capture-period husbandry. | `fao-deer-farming` |
| `a_shared` | Fencing, water and handling facilities | Record service units, consuming nodes and periods; attribute once by measured use or declared physical proxy, never double charge herd/capture/handover. | `fao-deer-farming` |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `c_live` | Final reference | Sum measured accepted live kg at one gate; divide each in-boundary amount by that sum. Reconcile opening/purchased/captured, births, deaths, transfers and closing stock. | `cp_live`; `cp_outputs` | amount per kg accepted living output | `fao-deer-farming` |
| `c_period` | Shared herd and facilities | Assign measured service to actual consuming node and period once; retain joint-output and stock ledger before normalization. | `cp_inputs`; `cp_live`; `cp_outputs` | attributable service per kg live output | `fao-deer-farming` |
| `calc_pathway_emissions` | `herd` | Use species- and management-compatible methods and retain disaggregated pathway totals. Convert N2O-N to N2O by 44/28 and NH3-N to NH3 by 17/14 exactly once; already molecular masses are not reconverted. Check methane against the documented available-carbon/methane-potential balance and nitrogen losses against each stage's available N. Indirect formation from previously volatilised N is a downstream transformation, not a second source-stage N loss. Attribute and normalize once; do not duplicate linked treatment or fate-model emissions.  Use matched raw-period quantities before allocation for physical screens: CH4 mass × 12/16 must not exceed the carbon available to the represented pathway; source-stage NH3 mass × 14/17 plus direct N2O mass × 28/44 and other source N losses must not exceed that stage's available N, after accounting for stocks and transfers. Bound each indirect N2O-N calculation by its documented volatilised or leached N precursor, not by subtracting that downstream transformation again from the source ledger. These are conservation checks, not emission factors or an empirical per-product range.| `cp_pathway_emissions` | kg named compound per final reference flow | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |
| `calc_feed_supply_and_intake` | `herd_feed` | Feed supply used by the represented operation = opening feed stock + receipts + on-site feed entering the operation - closing feed stock - documented unused returns or transfers out. Retain in-boundary spoilage, refusals and discarded leftovers in that supply. Actual intake = that supply - measured uneaten/discarded losses, after matching moisture/DM and period; use intake only for nutrition/metabolism. Opening stock retains its prior burden and is not another purchase. Trace any unused return or transfer and its burden destination; no automatic substitution credit. Attribute production once, through either the purchased-feed dataset or the represented on-site crop/collection node, never both for the same feed. Include actual waste treatment and manure contributions once, not as a second feed-production burden. | `cp_feed_supply_and_intake` | separate feed supply, intake and loss quantities, in matched as-fed/DM units | `fao-feed-loss-accounting-2018` |
| `calc_manure_n2o_coverage` | `review_herd_direct_n2o`; `review_herd_indirect_n2o` | For each actual manure stage, calculate direct N2O, volatilisation/deposition-derived indirect N2O, and applicable leaching/runoff-derived indirect N2O separately with documented species/system activity and factor basis. Convert N2O-N to molecular N2O by 44/28 once; do not reconvert molecular masses. Retain component worksheets. Where an existing N2O card covers both direct and indirect emissions, report their non-overlapping sum; where separate direct/indirect cards exist, assign each component once to its matching card and never also report the sum. Pasture deposition and land application use the managed-soil method, not a manure-storage factor. Assign foreground versus linked treatment/pasture coverage explicitly; a manure export does not erase earlier emissions, and already covered downstream emissions are not repeated. Account for stock, transfers and previous N losses in the nitrogen cascade; indirect N2O is a downstream transformation of its precursor, not a second source-stage N loss. Normalize attributed molecular masses once to the accepted reference output. Document inapplicability; absent pathway data are not zero. | `cp_manure_n2o_coverage` | kg molecular N2O by pathway and assigned existing card | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dq_identity` | Every lot | Prove species, residual placement, lawful source/trade and live condition; protected-species trade without authority blocks dataset. | taxonomy record; permit; gate record |
| `dq_mass` | Reference | Measure mass and head count at actual gate; reconcile deaths and stock changes without universal kg/head. | weigh ticket; register |
| `dq_period` | Herd, capture and assets | Cover full cohort/campaign and shared service periods once. | period ledger; invoices; campaign logs |
| `dq_binding` | Final exchanges | Resolve concrete UUID, property and unit group before downstream TIDAS process exchange creation. | detail-read and support-row evidence |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v_scope` | Every dataset | Reject unidentified species, unresolved bovine overlap, undocumented legal source or dead/post-slaughter reference. CPC examples do not license trade. | `un-cpc-2025`; `woah-wildlife-2021` |
| `v_route` | Farm or capture | Require exactly one source route per lot, actual herd or campaign records and living final gate; capture cannot acquire fictional farm inputs. | `fao-deer-farming`; `woah-wildlife-2021` |
| `v_balance` | Stock and outputs | Reconcile count/mass, births or captures, transfers, mortality, sales and closing stock; internal transfers are not duplicate final output. | `fao-deer-farming` |
| `v_attribution` | Joint outputs, periods and assets | Require actual handover set, explicit allocation, periods and one-time shared-service assignment. | `fao-deer-farming` |
| `v_identity` | All unresolved cards | Keep unconfirmed UUID blank; a final exchange requires compatible concrete identity/property/unit evidence. conditional flow scope alone is not a UUID. | |
| `v_pathway_emission_coverage` | `herd` | Require a pathway coverage ledger for enteric CH4 where biologically applicable, manure CH4, direct/indirect N2O, NH3 and relevant field emissions. Every pathway needs a measured/calculated value, a named linked process with matching coverage, or supported inapplicability; absent data cannot become zero. Keep wild life before capture outside managed husbandry, assess actual managed holding separately, and retain species-specific evidence. | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019`; `review-eea-manure-2023` |
| `v_foreground_emission_responsibility` | Actual operated nodes and linked services | Record responsibility for on-site fuel combustion and refrigerant leakage when applicable: either quantified foreground emissions or a named linked process explicitly covering them, never merely a fuel-supply or electricity-production input. Assess special-taxon biological and residue emissions using species/route evidence, without a generic livestock factor. Identify any unresolved pathway and withhold a completeness claim; document supported absence and prevent duplicate upstream/downstream accounting. | |
| `v_feed_supply_intake_separation` | All feed inputs | Reject an upstream feed inventory reduced by in-boundary refusal, spoilage or discarded leftovers without retaining their production burden. Reconcile supply, intake, stock, transfers and loss destinations under calc_feed_supply_and_intake. Do not reuse intake as supplied feed, assume zero-burden on-site feed or grant automatic avoided-product credits. | `fao-feed-loss-accounting-2018` |
| `v_manure_n2o_coverage` | Applicable manure and managed-soil N pathways | Require explicit direct and indirect pathway coverage, stage N balances and molecular-mass conversion. Map each component to an existing N2O card or an explicitly covering linked process once under calc_manure_n2o_coverage. Missing indirect-pathway evidence prevents a completeness claim; no default zero or duplicate aggregate-plus-components. | `review-ipcc-livestock-2019`; `review-ipcc-soils-2019` |

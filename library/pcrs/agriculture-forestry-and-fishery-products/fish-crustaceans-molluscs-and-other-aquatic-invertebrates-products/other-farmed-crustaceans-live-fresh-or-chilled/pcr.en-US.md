# Other farmed crustaceans, live, fresh or chilled

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR guides foreground data package construction for other farmed crustaceans placed on the market as live, fresh, or chilled product when no more specific farmed crustacean PCR applies. It covers declared broodstock, larvae, post-larvae, juveniles, seed, supplier stock, hatchery and nursery activity where controlled by the reporting operator, pond, tank, cage, pen, raceway, recirculating, brackish-water, marine, freshwater, integrated, or other declared aquaculture systems, grow-out or fattening, harvest, grading, live holding, chilling, packaging, and release at the declared gate.

Covered products include aquaculture-produced crustaceans other than farmed crabs, lobsters, Norway lobsters, rock lobsters, cold-water shrimps and prawns, and other farmed shrimps and prawns when the product is live, fresh, or chilled and remains an unprocessed primary product. Excluded products are wild crustaceans, wild catch only held or chilled after capture, all products with a more specific canonical PCR, frozen, dried, salted, brined, cooked, canned, peeled, picked-meat, prepared, preserved, ornamental, seed sold as a separate input, and shell or processing residues modelled as separate products.

This is a fallback PCR. A conforming dataset must state the species or species group and why a more specific farmed crustacean PCR does not apply.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | `pcr.agriculture-forestry-and-fishery-products.fish-crustaceans-molluscs-and-other-aquatic-invertebrates-products.other-farmed-crustaceans-live-fresh-or-chilled` |
| classification_refs | CPC 3.0 `04392`, `Other farmed crustaceans, live, fresh or chilled` |
| covered_products | farmed crustaceans not covered by a more specific canonical PCR, sold live, fresh, or chilled from declared aquaculture, nursery, grow-out, or fattening systems |
| excluded_products | farmed crabs; farmed lobsters; farmed Norway lobsters; farmed rock lobsters and sea crawfish; farmed shrimps and prawns with specific PCRs; wild crustaceans; frozen, dried, salted, brined, cooked, canned, peeled, picked-meat, prepared, preserved, ornamental, or seed products; shells, molts, mortalities, wastewater, and residues as separate products |
| representative_product | live or chilled other farmed crustacean at declared species or species group, culture route, market size, product form, holding condition, and gate |
| production_route | broodstock, larvae, post-larvae, juvenile, seed, or supplier stock input, hatchery or nursery where controlled, grow-out or fattening husbandry, harvest, grading, live holding or chilling, packaging, and declared gate release |
| market_state | live, fresh, or chilled farmed crustacean with declared species, fallback justification, seed or broodstock source, culture system, product basis, size grade, holding condition, packaging state, and gate |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | other farmed crustaceans as live, fresh, or chilled market product |
| How much | 1 kg |
| How well | declared species or species group, farmed proof, fallback justification, culture system, live/fresh/chilled state, whole or declared product basis, size grade, harvest and holding condition, and gate |
| How long or cycle | one aquaculture production batch, fattening batch, harvest lot, or reporting period normalized to marketable product output |
| reference_flow_link | Reference amount and product flow below |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 kg |
| Reference product flow | Crustaceans and Shellfish `429a82ee-b7ad-437e-9cfb-4c4530d82510` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | species or species group; fallback justification; broodstock, larval, post-larval, juvenile, seed, supplier, or fattening stock source; culture system; farmed proof or controlled husbandry period; product state; whole, live, fresh, chilled, soft-shell, molted, fattened, or declared product basis; size grade or count per kg; moisture, drainage, or ice-excluded basis; geography and declared gate; holding or chilling duration; feed regime; water source, salinity, and exchange; health, biosecurity, permit, certification, and unresolved Tiangong UUID substitutions |

The selected Tiangong reference flow is a candidate CPC 04392 identity with a broader display name. Replace it with an exact `Other farmed crustaceans, live, fresh or chilled` flow when Tiangong provides one, while retaining this PCR identity.

Mass is the primary reference basis. Count, basket, box, tub, live-tank, pond, cage, or size-grade records may be used only when net mass, count per kg or mean individual mass, product form, and sampling or tare method are retained.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |

| `life_stage_identity` | broodstock, eggs, larvae, post-larvae, juveniles, seed, molted animals, and transferred stock | Mass or count | kg, item, or life-stage count | Life-stage records must retain species, life stage, supplier or hatchery, batch, count, mass where measurable, health status, and transfer date. |
| `feed_mass_basis` | formulated feed, fresh bait, live feed, mollusc meat, trash fish, and supplementary feed | Mass | kg | Feed records must state wet, dry, as-fed, live-feed, or formulated-feed basis. Convert between bases only with measured moisture, supplier data, or retained farm recipe. |
| `water_salinity_and_volume` | hatchery, nursery, grow-out, fattening, live holding, washing, chilling, and wastewater | Salinity, mass, or volume | ppt, kg, or m3 | Preserve controlled water volume, salinity, water exchange, make-up water, recirculation, and discharge basis. |
| `energy_fuel_chemical_and_packaging_basis` | pumps, aeration, oxygenation, water exchange, filtration, lighting, chilling, live holding, boats, vehicles, chemicals, packaging, and ice | Energy, fuel, mass, volume, or item | kWh, MJ, L, kg, m3, or item | Record original electricity, fuel, oxygen, chemicals, packaging, ice, and energy carrier units before normalizing to the reference flow. |

## 5. System Boundary

The default boundary covers foreground-controlled other farmed crustacean production to the declared farm, harvest, packhouse, dispatch, or delivery gate:

1. Broodstock, egg, larval, post-larval, juvenile, seed, or supplier stock sourcing, including on-site hatchery and nursery activity when controlled by the reporting operator, or purchased stock disclosure when supplied by another hatchery, collector, fisher, or farm.
2. Hatchery, nursery, grow-out, or fattening husbandry, including stocking, feed, water intake and exchange, aeration, oxygenation, filtration, salinity control, health management, biosecurity, molting management where relevant, mortalities, and directly controlled maintenance.
3. Harvest, grading, washing, live holding, chilling, packaging, and declared gate release.
4. Delivery to the declared gate when the reference flow is delivered product beyond the farm, harvest, dispatch, or packhouse gate.

Capital goods and long-lived infrastructure are included only when the declared data package scope requires them. Purchased seed, larvae, juveniles, feed, packaging, ice, oxygen, electricity, fuel, chemicals, and transport services require upstream datasets unless the same operator controls and reports their production in the foreground package.

| `dq_identity` | reference product and biological stock | Species or species group, fallback justification, farmed status, biological starting condition, culture route, product form, and declared gate must be explicit. | reference flow metadata, stocking records, PCR selection note, harvest records, and sales or dispatch records |
| `dq_mass_balance` | stock, feed, mortality, harvest, and packout | Stocking, growth, mortality, escape, molt or shell residue, harvest, reject, and marketable product records must reconcile within declared tolerance; unexplained gaps require disclosure. | mass-balance worksheet, scale tickets, culture-unit records, packout records, and supervisor review |
| `dq_feed_and_water_basis` | feed, bait, water, and chemicals | Feed and bait basis, water salinity and exchange, treatment chemicals, and discharge route must be explicit. | invoices, feed declarations, farm logs, water-quality logs, treatment records, and discharge records |
| `dq_temporal_coverage` | all foreground rows | Data must cover the full production, grow-out, fattening, and final handling period, or disclose partial-cycle, partial-batch, or proxy coverage. | reporting calendar, batch records, harvest records, and coverage statement |
| `dq_boundary_disclosure` | all datasets | The dataset must disclose whether upstream stock, feed, water, packaging, delivery, capital goods, and infrastructure are foreground, linked upstream datasets, or excluded by scope. | dataset boundary statement, supplier records, upstream dataset links, and scope declaration |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Rule | Severity | Failure message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `val_reference_flow_uuid` | Reference product flow UUID equals `429a82ee-b7ad-437e-9cfb-4c4530d82510` unless a more specific Tiangong CPC 04392 farmed crustacean product flow is documented. | error | Reference flow must use the candidate CPC 04392 crustacean identity or document a reviewed replacement. |
| `val_fallback_scope` | Dataset states why no more specific farmed crustacean PCR applies. | error | Other farmed crustaceans fallback PCR requires species and PCR-selection justification. |
| `val_farmed_proof` | Dataset has controlled aquaculture, nursery, grow-out, or fattening evidence beyond wild capture and post-capture handling. | error | Wild capture only belongs under a wild crustacean PCR, not this farmed product PCR. |
| `val_product_state` | Product state is live, fresh, or chilled and excludes frozen, dried, salted, brined, prepared, preserved, ornamental, or processed product. | error | Product state is outside the other farmed crustacean live, fresh, or chilled PCR scope. |
| `val_mass_basis` | Product mass basis is declared as live, fresh, chilled, drained, ice-excluded, whole, soft-shell, molted, or another stated basis. | error | Product mass basis is missing or ambiguous. |
| `val_structured_sync` | `structured.yaml` is regenerated from the bilingual Markdown after edits. | error | Structured projection is out of sync with authored PCR Markdown. |

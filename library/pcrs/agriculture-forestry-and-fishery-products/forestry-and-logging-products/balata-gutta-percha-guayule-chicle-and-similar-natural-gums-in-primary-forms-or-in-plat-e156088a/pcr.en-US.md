# Balata, gutta-percha, guayule, chicle and similar natural gums in primary forms or in plates, sheets or strip

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers foreground data packages for non-wood natural gums and trans-polyisoprene or related natural gum materials sold in primary forms, blocks, plates, sheets, or strip. It applies to balata, gutta-percha, guayule gum or resin/rubber fractions, chicle, and similar natural gums when the declared product is an unvulcanized primary material rather than a formulated rubber, chewing gum, dental article, adhesive, or finished product.

The foreground boundary normally starts with the declared source stand, plantation, tapping campaign, harvested leaves, shrub biomass, or purchased raw latex/gum lot, and ends with the saleable primary gum at the producer gate. Dataset authors must disclose the botanical source or supplier source category, route, product form, moisture or dry matter basis, and whether resin separation, deresination, solvent extraction, boiling, or sheet/strip forming is included.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

If the foreground process produces only the declared primary gum product and internal residues are discarded, no allocation is required. If guayule rubber, guayule resin, bagasse, purified gutta fraction, resinous fraction, fuel residue, or another co-product leaves the system with economic value, allocate shared collection, extraction, and finishing burdens by dry mass as the default physical allocation. Use economic allocation only when the co-products have materially different functions and sale prices are documented for the same campaign. Internal rework is not a co-product; record it as a loop or yield loss. Residues used internally for process heat displace purchased energy only when measured and disclosed.

## 9. Validation Rules

- The dataset is invalid if it omits the required product qualifiers, especially gum type, product form, moisture basis, source system, and production route.
- The reference flow must be 1 kg net saleable product mass. Packaging and reusable containers are not part of the reference product mass.
- The dry-matter mass balance must reconcile source material, product, co-products, residues, and moisture losses. Unreconciled dry-matter loss above 5 percent of source dry matter requires explanation.
- Purchased raw gum, latex, leaves, shrub biomass, solvents, process aids, packaging, electricity, fuels, and transport services must be linked to upstream datasets when they cross the foreground boundary.
- Chicle routes must disclose tapping interval assumptions and whether tree damage or stand management activities are included.
- Gutta-percha routes must disclose whether material comes from tapping, leaves, prunings, crude blocks, or purchased raw material.
- Guayule routes must disclose aqueous or solvent extraction, resin/rubber separation state, bagasse treatment, and solvent recovery where applicable.
- Balata routes must disclose whether downstream gutta/resin separation is included or excluded.

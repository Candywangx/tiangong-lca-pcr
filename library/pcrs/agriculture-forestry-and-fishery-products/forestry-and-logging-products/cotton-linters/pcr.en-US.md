# Cotton linters

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers foreground data packages for cotton linters produced from ginned cottonseed. Cotton linters are the short seed-coat fibres remaining on cottonseed after the main cotton lint has been removed by ginning, and are normally removed from cottonseed by mechanical delinting at cottonseed oil mills or dedicated delinting facilities.

The PCR applies to raw or simply cleaned cotton linters sold as first-cut, second-cut, third-cut, or mill-run linters. It covers facility operations that receive cottonseed, clean and meter seed, mechanically delint seed, separate and clean linter fibre, bale or package linters, and dispatch saleable linter bales or lots.

This PCR excludes raw cotton lint for textile spinning, cottonseed itself, cottonseed oil, cottonseed meal, cottonseed hulls, gin motes unless declared as a separate co-product, purified cotton linter pulp, cellulose derivatives, paper, nonwovens, absorbent cotton, chemical-cotton products, and acid-delinted planting seed unless those operations are explicitly part of the declared foreground route and produce cotton linters as the reference product.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `cottonseed_coproduct_allocation` | If the foreground facility jointly produces cotton linters and delinted cottonseed, allocate shared receipt, cleaning, delinting, storage, and dispatch burdens between linters and delinted seed using a documented physical relationship when it reflects process causality. Otherwise use economic allocation with same-period prices and a sensitivity check. |
| `incoming_cottonseed_burden` | Purchased cottonseed enters with an upstream dataset. If the study boundary includes cotton ginning or seed ownership before delinting, allocate upstream cottonseed and ginning burdens consistently with the linked cotton or cottonseed PCR. |
| `off_grade_linter_treatment` | Off-grade linters sold for lower-value uses are co-products when they leave as saleable material; otherwise treat them as waste or internal rework according to measured fate. |
| `residue_fate` | Dust, hull fragments, seed cleaning rejects, and packaging waste must be tracked by fate, including disposal, composting, fuel use, feed use, or internal recycling. |

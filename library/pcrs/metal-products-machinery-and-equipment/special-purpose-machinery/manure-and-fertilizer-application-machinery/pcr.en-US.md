# Manure and fertilizer application machinery manufacture

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This rule covers manufacture of complete tractor-mounted or trailed implements for spreading solid or semi-solid manure or distributing granular mineral fertilizer. Distinguish apron/auger/beater manure spreaders from disc or metering fertilizer distributors by configured model. It excludes liquid spraying equipment, slurry transport tankers and injectors, self-propelled carrier vehicles, tractors, standalone fertilizer manufacture, separately sold replacement parts, farm application, crop yield, maintenance and end of life. This intentionally bounded machinery category needs configuration-aware materials, conditional finishing and count-to-net-mass normalization; neighbouring soil-preparation and baler methods do not describe its dosing and corrosive-contact configuration.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | pcr.metal-products-machinery-and-equipment.special-purpose-machinery.manure-and-fertilizer-application-machinery |
| classification_refs | CPC 3.0 44114; narrower scope context only, not an accepted mapping |

| excluded_products | Liquid applicators; carriers and tractors; separately sold parts; nutrient products and agricultural services |
| representative_product | One accepted empty complete implement with declared spread mechanism and options |
| production_route | Configured purchased inputs; site-performed fabrication, welding and finishing where present; assembly and factory acceptance |
| market_state | New, empty, accepted complete implement at factory gate; packaging separately inventoried |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Provide a manufactured implement capable of the declared manure or fertilizer distribution function |
| How much | 1 kg of one accepted complete configured machine, using its measured net mass M |
| How well | Acceptance against the declared model drawing, installed metering/spreading equipment and safety checks; not an agronomic performance equivalence |
| How long or cycle | One manufacturing delivery; no assumed operating lifetime, hectares or field cycle |
| reference_flow_link | `finished_machine` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Manure spreaders and fertilizer distributors `9d8cc9c8-458c-48f9-b716-518cf3e42007` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | model and serial/lot; mounted or trailed; solid/semi-solid manure or granular fertilizer; hopper/box capacity and empty state; spreader mechanism; drive, tyre, brake, electronic and weighing options; included shafts and guards; accepted net mass M; retained fluid state; site and period; supplier gates and foreground stages |

Every qualifier must be declared in the data package. Do not compare dissimilar machines solely because each inventory is expressed per kilogram. Transport packaging and fertilizer payload are outside net mass M.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | M = accepted net mass of one complete machine of the same configuration in kg; collect using cp_mass. |
| `energy_units` | electricity rows | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Preserve the meter unit; convert kWh to MJ using exactly 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ. Do not interpret the electricity property name as a combustion inventory. |
| `volume_units` | natural-gas and groundwater rows | Volume `93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66` | m3 | Retain measured volume and its conditions; do not invent gas density, water density or calorific value to switch to mass or energy. |
| `tyre_count` | `tyre` | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | Item(s) | Count accepted installed pneumatic tyres. This exchange numerator is a count; net-machine mass is separately weighed. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Materials and configured components received at declared supplier gates, with no implicit upstream steelmaking or component fabrication in foreground |
| starting_condition_role | Manufacturing input boundary for an accepted complete implement |
| product_classification_scope | Bounded solid/semi-solid manure and granular fertilizer implements within CPC 44114 context |
| recursive_input_rule | A purchased complete implement used as an input is a separately declared upstream product. Do not recursively regenerate this category; distinguish new production from refurbishment. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Link input-specific upstream datasets matching material, finished-component gate, geography, voltage and treatment state. Missing links remain disclosed coverage gaps. |
| disclosure | Report foreground factory stages, outsourced operations, component content, incoming transport coverage, protective packaging gate, capital-equipment policy and every exclusion; no complete cradle-to-gate claim without verified upstream and logistics closure. |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `manufacturing_gate` | foreground | Include every actual operation and attributable rework from declared received inputs through factory acceptance; distinguish purchased parts from site fabrication to prevent duplication. Use documented route records. |  |
| `conditional_finish` | finishing | Activate only documented finishing operations and chemical recipes. Manufacturer examples establish possible routes, not universal requirements or recipes. | `amazone-za-ts-2025` |
| `exclude_field` | farm_use | Keep manure and fertilizer production, field fuel, soil nutrient emissions, crop response and disposal outside this manufacturing inventory. No field service is included. |  |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `forming` | Stock cutting, forming and machining | conditional | Only when the site fabricates these parts; otherwise record purchased finished parts separately | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `joining` | Structural welding and dressing | conditional | Only when the site joins structural parts by welding | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `wet_surface` | Aqueous pretreatment and electrodeposition | conditional | Only when aqueous cleaning, conversion treatment or electrodeposition is actually performed; activate individual rows from the documented recipe | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `powder_finish` | Powder application and curing | conditional | Only when actual finishing uses powder; fuel row only for gas-fired curing | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `assembly` | Configured machinery assembly | required | Every accepted complete machine; activate component rows only when actually installed | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `acceptance` | Factory acceptance and net-mass determination | required | Every accepted complete machine | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `packaging` | Shipment protection at factory gate | conditional | Only when shipment protection is inside the declared delivery gate; disclose its exclusion otherwise | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |

Process records are separate contributors to one final accepted output, not seven separately traded reference products. Retain traceable internal-part transfer and bill-of-material records; internal transfers cancel within this foreground and do not receive duplicated upstream burdens. The cards below are explicit route-conditioned exchanges. Add each actual additional part, chemical, fuel, packaging piece, wastewater stream or measured elementary substance as its own identified row; absence of a card is not a cut-off permission. For outsourced finishing, replace site chemistry and energy with the exact purchased service or finished-part record and disclose its coverage.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `direct_attribution` | shared_operations | Use job tickets and submetering before allocation. Where a common meter remains, require a measured causal driver such as machine-hours for the identified operation, with all participating jobs and idle load disclosed; divide the attributable quantity by accepted units of the same configuration before mass normalization. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |
| `coproduct_decision` | saleable_outputs | Do not assume scrap is a co-product. Disclose destination and legal/product status. If multiple saleable co-products actually occur, seek subdivision; justify a physical relation or, when unavailable, documented economic/other allocation with sensitivity. No universal mass share or avoided-steel credit is prescribed. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |
| `rework_scrap` | manufacturing_losses | Retain rework and rejected-unit burdens attributable to the accepted reporting batch. Record recovered internal material once and exported wastes separately. Disclose upstream recycled-content method and any downstream treatment separately to prevent double credits. |  |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_mass` | all inventory rows | q_ref = q_item / M; q_item = exchange amount per one accepted finished machine; q_ref = exchange amount per 1 kg reference flow. | q_item; M; cp_mass | q_ref |  |

The finished_machine output is fixed at 1 kg and is not divided again. Apply the conversion to each other applicable row using the same configuration and batch; quantity numerator units remain unchanged. Mixed configurations must be separated, not averaged by count with a catalogue mass.

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `configuration_trace` | all rows | Trace every input to installed BOM, route and accepted unit; supplier finished parts do not also receive raw-stock burdens. Disclose remaining components as missing coverage until separate atomic records are added. | drawings, BOM, supplier receipts |
| `basis_quality` | cp_mass | M must be positive measured net mass, with the same delivered configuration, fluid state and acceptance gate as all collected exchanges. | calibration and weighing records |
| `coverage_quality` | all processes | Document full batch temporal coverage, meter overlap, rejects, rework, stock changes, outsourced stages and unmeasured emissions. A missing record is unknown, not zero or not_applicable. | ledger, coverage matrix and measurement uncertainty |
| `chemistry_quality` | wet_surface; powder_finish | Verify recipe, concentration and SDS for each supplied formulated chemical; characterize each outgoing waste stream and identify treatment separately from environmental emissions. | recipe, SDS, analyses and transfer tickets |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_reference` | reference | Reject missing qualifiers, payload/gross mass substitution, non-positive M or mismatch between configuration, cp_mass and finished_machine. Require 1 kg output and explicit normalize_mass on every non-reference applicable row. |  |
| `validate_atomic` | inventory | Require one physical exchange per row, verified public identity when supplied, correct property/unit, localized display and medium. Unresolved UUIDs do not authorize proxy substitution or mixed rows. |  |
| `validate_balance` | coverage | Reconcile installed mass, stock, waste, retained fluids and purchased parts using the actual BOM; independently check tyre counts. Reconcile utilities by stage; internal transfers cancel. Explain differences against recorded measurement uncertainty, without a fabricated numerical tolerance. |  |
| `validate_completeness` | dataset | Check every conditional stage against route evidence. Require missing chemicals, parts, test media and actual emissions to be split and collected before claiming a complete inventory; prohibit cradle-to-gate or service comparisons while upstream or functional coverage is incomplete. |  |
| `validate_allocation` | shared_operations | Require complete driver records and justification for allocation and scrap treatment; document sensitivity where another defensible allocation may change results. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | Manufacturing foreground process for a configured accepted implement |
| downstream_use | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| allowed_use | Input to a declared machinery supply model with identical configuration and disclosed upstream coverage |
| excluded_use | Farm application intensity, crop yield, fertilizer nutrient function, whole-life service or comparisons across different capacities without additional functional modelling |
| required_metadata | Model, configuration, empty state, M, retained fluids, manufacturer/site, reporting period, process route, voltage/geography, supplier gates, transport/packaging scope and allocation |
| required_quality_disclosure | Measured versus estimated quantities; unresolved identities; unmeasured emissions and components; upstream linkage completeness; uncertainty, data age and configuration limitations |
| update_trigger | Changed mechanism, capacity, BOM, coating chemistry, supplied component, energy mix, acceptance specification or mass protocol |

# Industrial single-jersey circular knitting machinery manufacture

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers manufacture of complete large-diameter single-jersey circular weft-knitting machines with declared diameter, gauge, needle/sinker mechanism, yarn feeding, drive, take-down and controls. Distinguish conventional and relative/spring-sinker layouts and actual delivered accessories. Include the complete configured machine at acceptance, with installed knitting tools, guard/frame, drive/control, feed/take-down modules and declared delivered creel. Exclude warp knitting, flat knitting, double-jersey/dial machines, seamless individual-item/hosiery machines, stitch-bonding, gimp/lace/embroidery/braid/net/tufting machines, looms and separately sold parts. CPC 44613 is broader than this boundary. Textile manufacturing in the customer mill, routine yarn consumption, fabric yield, mill utilities, maintenance/replacement needles and end-of-life are outside this manufacturing inventory. Actual factory knitting trials, test yarn, trial fabric handling and attributable utilities/lubricant/waste belong to manufacture. No textile production service or operating lifetime is included.

| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | pcr.metal-products-machinery-and-equipment.special-purpose-machinery.industrial-knitting-machinery |
| classification_refs | CPC 3.0 44613; narrower category context, not an accepted mapping |
| covered_products | Complete configured large-diameter single-jersey circular weft-knitting machines |
| excluded_products | Warp/flat/double-jersey/hosiery knitting; looms; other CPC44613 mechanisms and spare parts |
| representative_product | One complete accepted clean unloaded configured knitting machine |
| production_route | Receive steel stock or finished modules; actual frame fabrication and conditional finishing; cylinder/needle/sinker/cam and feeder/drive/control/take-down assembly; factory trial and acceptance |
| market_state | New accepted complete machine at factory gate, without yarn cones or trial fabric; packaging separately inventoried |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Provide the declared single-jersey circular weft-knitting machine |
| How much | 1 kg of the same complete accepted configured machine using measured net mass M |
| How well | Meet actual drawings and configuration-specific factory acceptance criteria. Record needle/sinker alignment, cam timing, feeder tension, drive/interlocks, lubrication, take-down and actual trial-loop/defect inspection with the declared test yarn, duration and calibrated instruments. Brochure speed, fabric production rate, efficiency, energy/CO2 savings and life claims do not prescribe generic factory quantities or acceptance limits. |
| How long or cycle | One manufacturing delivery; no assumed knitting service life or fabric-production cycle |
| reference_flow_link | finished_machine |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Knitting machines, stitch-bonding machines, machines for making gimped yarn, tulle, lace, embroidery, trimmings, braid or net and machines for tufting `533238d4-94ee-4db4-8e64-cfe66821248f` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | model/serial or batch; diameter/gauge; needle tracks and sinker layout; installed needle/sinker counts and grade/state; cylinder/cam/feeder/drive/take-down/control; delivered creel/guard/accessory and electronics inclusion; clean unloaded state without yarn/fabric; retained lubricant; measured M; factory/site and period; input gates; test yarn, trial duration and inspection; actual covered stages |

Weigh the same complete accepted delivery configuration on calibrated scales. Packing/shipping gross weight, nominal catalogue weight or a machine loaded with yarn/cloth does not replace M. Needle and sinker counts identify configuration; actual installed batch mass contributes to M without an assumed unit-piece weight. Kilogram normalization does not establish equivalent fabric-making performance across gauges, layouts or products.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | M = accepted net mass of one complete machine of the same configuration in kg; collect using cp_mass. |
| `energy_units` | electricity rows | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Preserve the meter unit; convert kWh to MJ using exactly 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ. Do not interpret the electricity property name as a combustion inventory. |
| `volume_units` | groundwater rows | Volume `93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66` | m3 | Retain measured volume and its conditions; do not invent gas density, water density or calorific value to switch to mass or energy. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Materials and configured components received at declared supplier gates, with no implicit upstream steelmaking or component fabrication in foreground |
| starting_condition_role | Manufacturing input boundary for an accepted complete machine |
| product_classification_scope | Large-diameter single-jersey circular weft-knitting machines within CPC 44613 context |
| recursive_input_rule | A purchased complete machine used as an input is a separately declared upstream product. Do not recursively regenerate this category; distinguish new production from refurbishment. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Link input-specific upstream datasets matching material, finished-component gate, geography, voltage and treatment state. Missing links remain disclosed coverage gaps. |
| disclosure | Report foreground factory stages, outsourced operations, component content, incoming transport coverage, protective packaging gate, capital-equipment policy and every exclusion; no complete cradle-to-gate claim without verified upstream and logistics closure. |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `manufacturing_gate` | foreground | Include every actual operation and attributable rework from declared received inputs through factory acceptance; distinguish purchased parts from site fabrication to prevent duplication. Use documented route records. |  |
| `conditional_finish` | finishing | Activate only documented finishing operations and chemical recipes. Manufacturer examples establish possible routes, not universal requirements or recipes. |  |
| `exclude_mill_production` | textile_use | Exclude customer-mill production, routine yarn/fabric output, mill utilities and maintenance/disposal. Include actual factory trials and their material/energy/waste; no textile production service is included. |  |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `forming` | Stock cutting, forming and machining | conditional | Only when the site fabricates these parts; otherwise record purchased finished parts separately | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `joining` | Structural welding and dressing | conditional | Only when the site joins structural parts by welding | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `wet_surface` | Aqueous cleaning and preparation | conditional | Only when aqueous cleaning or conversion treatment is actually performed; activate individual rows from the documented recipe | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `powder_finish` | Powder application and curing | conditional | Only when actual finishing uses powder; electrical curing rows only for actual electrically cured powder | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `assembly` | Configured machinery assembly | required | Every accepted complete machine; activate component rows only when actually installed | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `acceptance` | Factory acceptance and net-mass determination | required | Every accepted complete machine | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `packaging` | Shipment protection at factory gate | conditional | Only when shipment protection is inside the declared delivery gate; disclose its exclusion otherwise | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |

Process records are separate contributors to one final accepted output, not seven separately traded reference products. Retain traceable internal-part transfer and bill-of-material records; internal transfers cancel within this foreground and do not receive duplicated upstream burdens. The cards below are explicit route-conditioned exchanges. Add each actual additional part, chemical, fuel, packaging piece, wastewater stream or measured elementary substance as its own identified row; absence of a card is not a cut-off permission. For outsourced finishing, replace site chemistry and energy with the exact purchased service or finished-part record and disclose its coverage.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `direct_attribution` | shared_operations | Use job tickets and submetering before allocation. Where a common meter remains, require a measured causal driver such as machine-hours for the identified operation, with all participating jobs and idle load disclosed; divide the attributable quantity by accepted units of the same configuration before mass normalization. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |
| `coproduct_decision` | saleable_outputs | Do not assume scrap is a co-product. Disclose destination and legal/product status. If multiple saleable co-products actually occur, seek subdivision; justify a physical relation or, when unavailable, documented economic/other allocation with sensitivity. No universal mass share or avoided-steel credit is prescribed. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |
| `rework_scrap` | manufacturing_losses | Retain rework and rejected-unit burdens attributable to the accepted reporting batch. Record recovered internal material once and exported wastes separately. Disclose upstream recycled-content method and any downstream treatment separately to prevent double credits. |  |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_mass` | all inventory rows | q_ref = q_item / M; q_item = exchange amount per one accepted finished machine; q_ref = exchange amount per 1 kg reference flow. | q_item; M; cp_mass | q_ref |  |

The finished_machine output is fixed at 1 kg and is not divided again. Apply the conversion to each other applicable row using the same configuration and batch; quantity numerator units remain unchanged. Mixed configurations must be separated, not averaged by count with a catalogue mass.

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `configuration_trace` | all rows | Trace every input to installed BOM, route and accepted unit; supplier finished parts do not also receive raw-stock burdens. Disclose remaining components as missing coverage until separate atomic records are added. | drawings, BOM, supplier receipts |
| `basis_quality` | cp_mass | M must be positive measured net mass, with the same delivered configuration, fluid state and acceptance gate as all collected exchanges. | calibration and weighing records |
| `coverage_quality` | all processes | Document full batch temporal coverage, meter overlap, rejects, rework, stock changes, outsourced stages and unmeasured emissions. A missing record is unknown, not zero or not_applicable. | ledger, coverage matrix and measurement uncertainty |
| `chemistry_quality` | wet_surface; powder_finish | Verify recipe, concentration and SDS for each supplied formulated chemical; characterize each outgoing waste stream and identify treatment separately from environmental emissions. | recipe, SDS, analyses and transfer tickets |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_reference` | reference | Reject missing qualifiers, test-yarn-loaded or shipping-gross mass substitution, non-positive M or mismatch between configuration, cp_mass and finished_machine. Require 1 kg output and explicit normalize_mass on every non-reference applicable row. |  |
| `validate_atomic` | inventory | Require one physical exchange per row, verified public identity when supplied, correct property/unit, localized display and medium. Unresolved UUIDs do not authorize proxy substitution or mixed rows. |  |
| `validate_balance` | coverage | Reconcile installed mass, stock, waste, retained fluids and purchased parts using the actual BOM; independently reconcile installed needle/sinker counts and their measured batch mass. Reconcile utilities by stage; internal transfers cancel. Explain differences against recorded measurement uncertainty, without a fabricated numerical tolerance. |  |
| `validate_completeness` | dataset | Check every conditional stage against route evidence. Require missing chemicals, parts, test media and actual emissions to be split and collected before claiming a complete inventory; prohibit cradle-to-gate or service comparisons while upstream or functional coverage is incomplete. |  |
| `validate_allocation` | shared_operations | Require complete driver records and justification for allocation and scrap treatment; document sensitivity where another defensible allocation may change results. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | Manufacturing foreground process for a configured accepted machine |
| downstream_use | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| allowed_use | Input to a declared machinery supply model with identical configuration and disclosed upstream coverage |
| excluded_use | Textile production service, mill operation, or life-cycle comparisons across gauges, sinker layouts and fabric products without separate functional modelling |
| required_metadata | Model, configuration, empty state, M, retained fluids, manufacturer/site, reporting period, process route, voltage/geography, supplier gates, transport/packaging scope and allocation |
| required_quality_disclosure | Measured versus estimated quantities; unresolved identities; unmeasured emissions and components; upstream linkage completeness; uncertainty, data age and configuration limitations |
| update_trigger | Changed needle/sinker layout, diameter/gauge, BOM, coating/lubricant chemistry, test-yarn composition, supplied component, energy mix, acceptance specification or mass protocol |

# Metal laser powder-bed-fusion machinery manufacture

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers manufacture of new complete configured metal laser powder-bed-fusion machines. Declare build envelope, laser/scan optics, platform, powder delivery/recoating, chamber/gas handling, control and actual delivered cooling/filtration modules. Exclude polymer printers, binder jetting, directed-energy deposition, electron-beam systems, subtractive laser tools, separately traded spares and whole customer printing cells. CPC44920 is broader than this boundary. Include actual factory calibration, chamber trials, test builds, cleaning/rework and their attributable material, energy and wastes. Customer metal-part production, routine powder/gas use, post-processing services, maintenance, lifetime and disposal are excluded. This is a machine-manufacturing reference, not a kilogram-of-printed-metal service.

| canonical_pcr_id | pcr.metal-products-machinery-and-equipment.special-purpose-machinery.metal-laser-powder-bed-fusion-machinery |
| classification_refs | CPC 3.0 44920; narrower category context, not an accepted mapping |
| covered_products | Complete configured metal laser powder-bed-fusion machines |
| excluded_products | Polymer/binder-jet/DED/electron-beam systems, subtractive laser tools, customer print cells and spare parts |
| representative_product | One complete accepted clean unloaded configured metal-LPBF machine |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Provide the declared complete metal-LPBF machine |
| How much | 1 kg of the same complete accepted configured machine using measured net mass M |
| How well | Meet actual drawings and configuration-specific factory acceptance criteria. Record laser/optical calibration, scan and platform positioning, layer delivery, chamber leak/purge and oxygen-sensor checks, filter/cooling function, safety/interlocks and actual test-coupon inspection with declared alloy, gas, duration and calibrated instruments. Manufacturer laser ratings, build rates and typical operating power are not manufacturing amounts or universal acceptance limits. |
| How long or cycle | One manufacturing delivery; no assumed printing service life or metal-part production cycle |
| reference_flow_link | finished_machine |

| Field | Value |

| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Machines for additive manufacturing `de667e62-2a29-40c7-9481-31d32848eb58` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | model/serial or batch; build envelope; laser count/type/wavelength; scan optics and platform/recoater configuration; chamber and powder/gas-loop/filter constituents; actual delivered cooling/control/guards/accessories; separate-module delivery gates and included fluids/build plate; clean unloaded state without test powder/coupons/residues; measured M; manufacturer/site/period and input gates; trial alloy/powder state, gas/purity, duration, collection and inspection; actual covered stages |

Weigh the same complete accepted clean delivery configuration on calibrated scales. Include installed and declared delivered modules, the delivered build plate and declared retained working fluids; exclude loose powder, coupons, residues, spare tooling and transport packaging. Catalogue machine weight and nominal operating consumption never replace M or factory measurements. Kilogram normalization does not establish equal printing performance across build envelopes, laser counts, alloys or scan strategies. The broad public reference name is restricted by these qualifiers and does not extend this PCR to all additive technologies.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | M = accepted net mass of one complete machine of the same configuration in kg; collect using cp_mass. |
| `energy_units` | electricity rows | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Preserve the meter unit; convert kWh to MJ using exactly 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ. Do not interpret the electricity property name as a combustion inventory. |
| `volume_units` | groundwater rows | Volume `93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66` | m3 | Retain measured volume and its conditions; do not invent gas density, water density or calorific value to switch to mass or energy. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Materials and configured components received at declared supplier gates, with no implicit upstream steelmaking or component fabrication in foreground |
| starting_condition_role | Manufacturing input boundary for an accepted complete machine |
| product_classification_scope | Complete metal laser powder-bed-fusion machines within broader CPC44920 context |
| recursive_input_rule | A purchased complete machine used as an input is a separately declared upstream product. Do not recursively regenerate this category; distinguish new production from refurbishment. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Link input-specific upstream datasets matching material, finished-component gate, geography, voltage and treatment state. Missing links remain disclosed coverage gaps. |
| disclosure | Report foreground factory stages, outsourced operations, component content, incoming transport coverage, protective packaging gate, capital-equipment policy and every exclusion; no complete cradle-to-gate claim without verified upstream and logistics closure. |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `manufacturing_gate` | foreground | Include every actual operation and attributable rework from declared received inputs through factory acceptance; distinguish purchased parts from site fabrication to prevent duplication. Use documented route records. |  |
| `conditional_finish` | finishing | Activate only documented finishing operations and chemical recipes. Manufacturer examples establish possible routes, not universal requirements or recipes. |  |
| `exclude_customer_printing` | printing_use | Exclude customer metal-part production and post-processing, routine feedstock/gas throughput, customer utilities and maintenance/disposal. Include actual factory calibration/test builds and their separate material, gas, energy and wastes; no additive-part-production service is included. |  |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `delivery_configuration` | cp_mass; accepted_delivery | Before cp_mass weighing, identify every accepted delivered module by serial/configuration and gate, including detachable chiller, filter unit and actual retained fluids. Prepare the same complete accepted configuration for calibrated physical weighing. Document temporary disassembly and separate module check-weighings as reconciliation records; catalogue/component estimates never replace measured M. Factory-only vacuum/chiller/air equipment and loose trial powder are excluded from delivery mass and have separately disclosed utility/tooling coverage. |  |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `forming` | Stock cutting, forming and machining | conditional | Only when the site fabricates these parts; otherwise record purchased finished parts separately | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `joining` | Structural welding and dressing | conditional | Only when the site joins structural parts by welding | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `wet_surface` | Aqueous cleaning and preparation | conditional | Only when aqueous cleaning or conversion treatment is actually performed; activate individual rows from the documented recipe | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `powder_finish` | Powder application and curing | conditional | Only when actual finishing uses powder; electrical curing rows only for actual electrically cured powder | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `assembly` | Configured machinery assembly | required | Every accepted complete machine; activate component rows only when actually installed | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `acceptance` | Factory acceptance and net-mass determination | required | Every accepted complete machine | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |
| `packaging` | Shipment protection at factory gate | conditional | Only when shipment protection is inside the declared delivery gate; disclose its exclusion otherwise | foreground manufacturing | per 1 kg reference flow; collected per one accepted finished machine |

Process records are separate contributors to one final accepted output, not seven separately traded reference products. Retain traceable internal-part transfer and bill-of-material records; internal transfers cancel within this foreground and do not receive duplicated upstream burdens. The cards below are explicit route-conditioned exchanges. Add each actual additional part, chemical, fuel, packaging piece, wastewater stream or measured elementary substance as its own identified row; absence of a card is not a cut-off permission. For outsourced finishing, replace site chemistry and energy with the exact purchased service or finished-part record and disclose its coverage.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `coproduct_decision` | saleable_outputs | Do not assume scrap is a co-product. Disclose destination and legal/product status. If multiple saleable co-products actually occur, seek subdivision; justify a physical relation or, when unavailable, documented economic/other allocation with sensitivity. No universal mass share or avoided-steel credit is prescribed. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |
| `rework_scrap` | manufacturing_losses | Retain rework and rejected-unit burdens attributable to the accepted reporting batch. Record recovered internal material once and exported wastes separately. Disclose upstream recycled-content method and any downstream treatment separately to prevent double credits. |  |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_mass` | all inventory rows | q_ref = q_item / M; q_item = exchange amount per one accepted finished machine; q_ref = exchange amount per 1 kg reference flow. | q_item; M; cp_mass | q_ref |  |

The finished_machine output is fixed at 1 kg and is not divided again. Apply the conversion to each other applicable row using the same configuration and batch; quantity numerator units remain unchanged. Mixed configurations must be separated, not averaged by count with a catalogue mass.

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `configuration_trace` | all rows | Trace every input to installed BOM, route and accepted unit; supplier finished parts do not also receive raw-stock burdens. Disclose remaining components as missing coverage until separate atomic records are added. | drawings, BOM, supplier receipts |
| `basis_quality` | cp_mass | M must be positive measured net mass, with the same delivered configuration, fluid state and acceptance gate as all collected exchanges. | calibration and weighing records |
| `coverage_quality` | all processes | Document full batch temporal coverage, meter overlap, rejects, rework, stock changes, outsourced stages and unmeasured emissions. A missing record is unknown, not zero or not_applicable. | ledger, coverage matrix and measurement uncertainty |
| `chemistry_quality` | wet_surface; powder_finish | Verify recipe, concentration and SDS for each supplied formulated chemical; characterize each outgoing waste stream and identify treatment separately from environmental emissions. | recipe, SDS, analyses and transfer tickets |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_reference` | reference | Reject missing qualifiers, powder-loaded or shipping-gross mass substitution, non-positive M or mismatch between configuration, cp_mass and finished_machine. Require 1 kg output and explicit normalize_mass on every non-reference applicable row. |  |
| `validate_atomic` | inventory | Require one physical exchange per row, verified public identity when supplied, correct property/unit, localized display and medium. Unresolved UUIDs do not authorize proxy substitution or mixed rows. |  |
| `validate_balance` | coverage | Reconcile installed mass, stock, waste, retained fluids and purchased parts using the actual BOM; independently reconcile delivered laser/optical/platform/gas/cooling module content with measured BOM mass, and trial powder/coupons/returns/residues with measured batch consumption. Reconcile utilities by stage; internal transfers cancel. Explain differences against recorded measurement uncertainty, without a fabricated numerical tolerance. |  |
| `validate_completeness` | dataset | Check every conditional stage against route evidence. Require missing chemicals, parts, test media and actual emissions to be split and collected before claiming a complete inventory; prohibit cradle-to-gate or service comparisons while upstream or functional coverage is incomplete. |  |
| `validate_allocation` | shared_operations | Require complete driver records and justification for allocation and scrap treatment; document sensitivity where another defensible allocation may change results. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | Manufacturing foreground process for a configured accepted machine |
| downstream_use | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| allowed_use | Input to a declared machinery supply model with identical configuration and disclosed upstream coverage |
| excluded_use | Additive-part-production service, customer print-shop operation or performance comparisons across build envelopes, laser layouts, alloys and printed parts without separate functional modelling |
| required_metadata | Model, configuration, empty state, M, retained fluids, manufacturer/site, reporting period, process route, voltage/geography, supplier gates, transport/packaging scope and allocation |
| required_quality_disclosure | Measured versus estimated quantities; unresolved identities; unmeasured emissions and components; upstream linkage completeness; uncertainty, data age and configuration limitations |
| update_trigger | Changed laser/optical/platform/recoater configuration, build envelope, gas/filter/cooling module, BOM, supplied fluid/cleaner/coating chemistry, test-powder alloy/state, gas recipe, supplier gate, energy mix, acceptance specification or mass protocol |
